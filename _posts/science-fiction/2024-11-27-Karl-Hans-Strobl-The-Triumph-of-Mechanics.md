# Core: 6/9. I like the story that brilliant mechanic defeats the capitalists and the bureaucrat by his wit, and it told well though the technology here is a bit fantastic.


# Character: 5/9. It provides memorable figures with vivid depiction.



# Plot: 8/9. Humour, conflicts and drama abound in this work. This score is for its vivid, interesting, funny scenes like rabbits in the singer's cleavage. Thought I doubt why did the mayor think Hopkins couldn't invent rabbits that could eat since he was able to invent rabbits could reproduce asexually.

Hopkins, the mechanical engineer of universal genius, asked his bosses to raise his salary due to his indispensability and contribution. Stricker inclined to accept but Vorderteil opposed this decision out of fear that he would come up with new whim sooner or later once he was satisfied. Vorderteil was acquainted with the town's mayor, so when he learnt that Hopkins had bought a vacant lot and had filed a building permit to build a new factory, and when he reminded Hopkins of capability of making glazed colored glass toys that never break, he asked the mayor to foil Hopkins's nefarious plan. 

Hopkins came to the Civil Engineering Office for his factory, but it told him to address the Police Office, which sent him to the Technical Assistance Office, which wanted him to the Civil Engineering Office. At this point, he bought two enormous mechanical mastiffs to declare that he would set a billion mechanical rabbits and the mayor took the responsibility of the catastrophe, if the mayor disapproved his factory.


The mayor ridiculed his revenge until he found rabbits indeed disturbed people's life like vermin because they were hard to catch and break. Vorderteil thought Hopkins succeeded in developing asexual reproduction and therefore rabbits were reproducing themselves endlessly.

In order to appease people's indignity, the mayor imitated Napol√©on to calm people with festivities commemorating the poet Schiller. Though rabbits constantly caused turmoil in the commemoration. Hopkins stood on stage and denounced the mayor took responsibility of all these nuisances, and if his projects meet more obstacles, this time he will repeat the scene with rabbits that can eat.

The tired and pensive mayor finally gave in but he asked how is it possible to develop mechanical rabbits that can eat. Hopkins replied it was exactly a real living rabbit.


# World and Others: 1/9. Hopkins had many ways to use his intelligence against the bureaucrat, yet he chose the most dramatic way. With this kind of technology of firm colored glass and asexual reproduction, he only used it to create toys. Plus, why did he need a factory if his rabbits could reproduce themselves?


# Overall: 5/9. I'm sad to find out that Strobl became a Nazi and devoted his life to it.
