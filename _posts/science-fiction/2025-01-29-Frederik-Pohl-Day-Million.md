# Plot: 4/9. It's a bizarre love story happened in Day Million.
Dora was a charming, sexy, and cute dancer whose appearance resembled the normal female despite his tail, pelt and gill slits. 
Don was a 187-year-old, muscular and cybernetic sailor who travelled all the time around the universe.

Dora one day stumbled against Don. Don immediately asked, "Will you marry me?" Dora replied, "Wednesday." And they indeed did this on Wednesday. After that, they bade farewell to each other forever, because they exchanged their mathematical analogues so that they only needed to turn on that machine when they missed each other.


# Core: 4/9. What will love in the future be like?
LOL
> The love story did not entail the sublimation of the urge to rape and concurrent postponement of the instinct to submit which we at present understand in such matters.

By the way, the chauvinistic undertone was so nasty. Could you explain to me what is the aptitude of being a woman when they are just eggs?
> If they found a child whose aptitude were for being a woman, they made him one.


# Character: 4/9. Two main characters and their from style impressed me indeed.



# World and Others: 0/9. What do you expect from a love story? It's surreal and illogical as usual. Why do they need registration for exchanging analogues and why did analogues not sell as goods or services?



# Overall: 3/9. Pohl had a good writing style that it's hard for me to repel his work, although he's not my cup of tea because of his mediocrity.
