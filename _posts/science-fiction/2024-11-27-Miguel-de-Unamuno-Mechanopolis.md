# Core: 2/9. It's a story on a world run by only machines that have consciousness of human without any trace of human. But it puzzled me that why did these machines feed this uninvited person? And where did human who once lived in this Mechanopolis go? Plainly speaking, it's tedious and lack of conflicts.



# Character: 1/9. I cannot sympathize with the hero who just couldn't stand machines' pity and then escape instead of investigating the truth of Mechanopolis.


# Plot: 4/9. Too boring. Why didn't hero stand the loneliness and pity since there are plenty of art, entertainment and books for him.
A person in desert desperate for water, so he fed himself in an oasis of Mechanopolis. 

At first, he was attracted by this magnificent place: He jumped to a train. He registered a hotel where he also could ordered dishes for dinner. As long as he waved, a car would stop to carry him to places he wanted. He therefore visited geological park, art galleries, Museum of Paleontology that was set to study human race who once lived in the place before machines had supplanted them, concert Hall and Grand theater. 

He then knew machines predicted he would have a rough time here though newspaper commenting on him. He couldn't stand the loneliness out of his eager for some reaction, only to get some pity of machines on newspaper. He finally crushed, rushed out of Mechanopolis and returned to the civilization.

And ever since he developed a true hatred towards progress and machines.

# World and Others: 4/9. In fact, I thought technology here can all be realized today including the auto-generated newspaper.


# Overall: 3/9.
