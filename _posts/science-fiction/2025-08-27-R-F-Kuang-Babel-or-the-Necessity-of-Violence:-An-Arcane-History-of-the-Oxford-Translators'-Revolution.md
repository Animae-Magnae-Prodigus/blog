# Voice: 4/9
There's plenty of room for improvement in Kuang's ability of writing. She was fond of letting Robin to summarise everything dryly, omitting complete conversations, neglecting the depiction of environmental scenes, and delivering didactic, unrealistic, complementary and polemic explanations. As a result, the characters appeared cardboard, the plot appeared superficial, and the world appeared unattractive.

# Plot: 6/9. The fallible and gullible characters especially the protagonist, tedious academic life without enough suspension, and depressive ambience involving morality, blood and violence made me barely desert this book midway. Nevertheless, the impressive tragic ending somehow deserved the previous reading crucifixion.
After the protagonist's mother and all his relatives had died in a cholera thriving in Macao, he was saved and adopted by an Oxford professor called Lovell. It turned out that Lovell had hired a foreign nanny to teach the protagonist English in the past and had visited Canton not long before the cholera. The protagonist thought Lovell might be his father but Lovell merely want to adopt him as the ward rather than son.

Lovell demanded him to comprehend Greek and Latin as well as English and Chinese. Once when the protagonist was too preoccupied with the novel to obey the schedule, Lovell abused him badly and shouted that the protagonist could return to China if he couldn't study well. 

After several years of hard learning, the protagonist got the matriculation through special recommendation. He there met his one of his neighbours called Ramy, an Indian who was also sponsored by a British and had been prepared long for the matriculation. When they visited stores together and a drunken white boy humiliated Ramy's black skin, the protagonist escaped immediately hoping to avoid a conflict. Despite this episode, the two quickly became good friends. Before long, the duo got acquaintance with other neighbours, but they seemed to get along ill.

In a high tower called Babel, the protagonist and Ramy were introduced to his classmates, Victoire and Letty. He learned that he was trained to be a magic translator that could incant translation to manipulate specially crafted silver bars.

When the protagonist helped Ramy to get back his satchel, he came across a futile theft. Amazed at an extremely similar appearance of one of these thieves, he helped them to get rid of chasers.
That doppelganger called Griffin Harley one day approached him, introduced himself as the last child adopted by Lovell. He claimed that Lovell actually had his own family and children, and his adoption was merely out of better exploitation of their motherland for the British Crown. So Griffin one day faked his death, attended an organization called the Hermes Society, stole the silver to the countries in need.
Feeling sympathy towards the colonies and the alienation and discrimination sensed in Britain, the protagonist continued assisting them in stealing silver bars out of the tower, even without much knowledge on the running details of the Hermes Society.

One day, the protagonist was invited by Pendennis, a upper-class rich profligate, to a wine party and he seemed to impress them with his knowledge on translation. Letty, however, had been opposing his attendance all the way and soon Victoire told that it was because Letty had a brother died from the lifestyle of overdrinking in this university.

The protagonist warned Griffin that Babel had just upgraded its burglar-proof system, which Griffin dismissed and handed Robin a silver bar to help him hide. But in the theft, Griffin's men triggered the alarm, the protagonist barely tricked the professor that it was the fault of the new equipment. Robin had to suture himself alone and Griffin didn't contact him at all. So no wonder when the next time Griffin came up with another demand of storing bombs inside Robin's dormitory, the protagonist refused any connection with Griffin and the organization.

The protagonist thus devoted himself to the intense learning and school drama: Letty, who had been bickering with Ramy all the time, in fact secretly loved him. Ramy, who knew that secret, shunned away from her because he was black. Letty thus cried for his adamant rejection in front of the protagonist.
Meanwhile, Victoire didn't favour the fact that she helped British to learn her mother tongue for the benefit that would never share with her motherland. Letty didn't understand that feeling, and therefore the duo even had a cold war.

Luckily, after they passed the final examination, all of their relationship ameliorated. Under Letty's request, they went to a luxurious promenade together. However, drunken Pendennis insulted Letty and Victoire and disrupted their tranquil evening.
The four wanted to continue the celebration on the roof of Babel, only to find that translators who couldn't either stand outsiders' discrimination held a party of translators. As to why the seniors didn't tell them, it was because unless they experienced a terrible party hosted by the outsiders, the four wouldn't have understood the significance of translators' own party.

The protagonist accidentally found that Victoire and Ramy was sent by Hermes to steal from Babel by Anthony, a senior who had faked his death like Griffin and attended Hermes hereafter. Unfortunately, anti-theft mechanisms were improved so well that the protagonist managed to save the two at the cost of his capture. 
He admitted his aiding and abetting Hermes' thefts to Lovell. Nevertheless, Lovell released him because the excellent protagonist would play an important role in the translation henceforth.

The four were pioneered to accompany Lovell for the task of helping British merchants sell opium to Chinese. Opium was now forbidden by the Chinese government for it harmed the well-being of their citizens. British merchants claimed that it was free trade, demanding their confiscated contraband back. The protagonist served as one of two translators in the negotiation.
After that, the commander demanded to talk with the protagonist alone and asked him the British attitude. The protagonist honestly told him that British despised Chinese. After that talk, the commander destroyed all the opium, which meant the prelude of an inevitable war. 

Lovell kept asking what exactly the protagonist had spoken to the commander. The protagonist couldn't bear up with Lovell's blatant insult to his ethnicity, motherland and his mother and eventually killed Lovell on the spur of the moment.
His friends offered to clean the crime scene and hide the murder.

From Lovell's correspondence, the protagonist found out that Lovell actually conspired with some British long time ago in order to bait Chinese into a war. When the three discussed whether they should convey that information to Hermes, Letty's overhearing made them confess Hermes.

Soon they found they couldn't hide the disappearance of Lovell any more from suspecting professors. A professor impersonated the member of Hermes to solicit more information from the protagonist.
Luckily, the protagonist saw through it and Anthony led the four into a secret base and introduced them to other comrades.

Letty, the daughter of a British admiral, felt their plans of disrupting the war disgusting and secretly reported to the police. She even pointed a gun at them to persuade their surrender. Eventually she killed Ramy. all the members were killed by the police except for the protagonist and Victoire.

In the prison, Sterling tortured the protagonist for intelligence on Griffin who had some old grievance with him years ago. Griffin came to rescue the protagonist and Victoire. Therefore Sterling and Griffin ended under each other's attack.

The protagonist and Victoire came back to the devastated base and buried their comrades' corpses. They then broke into Babel and occupied there, hoping its dysfunction and strike could force the parliament into reconsidering the war with China. Some academics and townspeople volunteered to join them.

In the end, the barricades were breached under the siege of British army. Some people like Victoire chose to live and they escaped away before the army's ultimate attack, whereas the protagonist and some academics eventually sacrificed themselves by destroying Babel.








# Character: 5/9. Most of them weren't adorable and sounded extremely alike. 
## Robin Swift
This kind of fallible, passive and tedious protagonist really exacerbated the discomfort rendered by the depressive plot. He made fateful mistakes so often that I barely abandoned this book and blacklisted Kuang midway:
+ Why did the protagonist go to the pub called Twisted Root upon hearing its location from Victoire?
+ He agreed to serve as the spy of an organization unwilling to give him anything including information. I don't appreciate his imprudence and naivety. Didn't he fear that this kind of ignorant behaviour only eventually benefit another dictatorship or colonist like Britain?
+ He failed to activate the WuXing bar and fell into the energy's hand.
+ He initially planned to pretend himself as a innocent passerby, so I was extremely dumbfounded at his immediate acknowledgment of guilt after Lovell's minor interrogation without concrete proofs and extreme violence.
+ Why did the protagonist have to tell the location of Hermes' safety house? He could lie that he knew nothing and just do this due to his childish naivety.
+ I didn't believe at first that a lurid and accidental murder would let a professor memorise a talented student for 5 years. The protagonist could have asked Griffin in details when they were alone. 
+ He deteriorated his own condition as well as aggravated the situation between two countries by rendering such an improper response.
+ He could just have pretended the murder as a disappearance like Anthony's case. Without evidence, the official could not arrest him for long and there was no need to stay in a refuge. He could have claimed that he knew nothing and inherited Lovell's heritage as the ward. Being a fugitive only confirmed his suspicion.
+ Why didn't he take the dying Griffin along with them?
+ After so many things, the protagonist still didn't know the art of preparation. He captured Babel without enough food and supplies! His plan would be doomed had not it been for others' assistance and his good luck!
+ why did not he revenge for his friend and killed Letty?

## others 
Why did Ramy and Victoire wear only black rather than masks for their heist?

# World : 6/9. I would have appropriated this aspect better if the magic could blend in the world and history better and if characters applied the magic to their daily life more frequently.
+ What was meaning of the clerks, if the translator manipulating silver bar could possess more unimaginable power and render better supernatural effect than the so-called servants of God? Why didn't translators be seen as the real chosen ones? Why didn't people there worship them instead of some charlatans?

+ Since Macao was a British colony at that time, Robin joined a Malacca school that could teach him Chinese, and Babel was abundant with money, why was it that hard to summon aboriginal translators to Babel?

+ I like the setting that magic derived from lost meanings during the translation, but I am curious that if word A was translated from word B which also had the meaning of C and D, then how could it be possible that only C was bewitched by the silver bar? Based on the context, I supposed that the actual functionality of the word pairs needed lots of experiments to confirm.

+ Ramy said what made the English superior was the guns and the willingness to use them on innocent people. Then why didn't translators figure out some mechanics to defend themselves against guns? Considering the mentioned applications of silver bars in ancient times, why didn't silver bar predominate the warfare millennia ago?


# Core: 7/9. Did the plot that only show the process and cause of violence rather than its consequence corroborate the necessity of violence?
in addition, I didn't think the cruelty of the British colonialism was not completely delineated in the context. The protagonist and his companions' fatuous participation in a dangerous association led to their final tragedy, which, from my perspective, seemed not adequate enough to demonstrate the core.
