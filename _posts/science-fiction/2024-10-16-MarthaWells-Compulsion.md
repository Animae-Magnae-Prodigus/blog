# Core: 3/9
The reason is so lame for me that Murderbot didn't rescue Sekai immediately because HubSystem thought watching a employee die and clog the collectors would not affect the overall productivity.

Still, the idea that Murderbot touches and rebels against governor module slightly because of the entertainment media works for me.

# Character: 6/9. What did you expect from a novelette with the first-person perspective of a Murderbot? At least it depicts the feelings of Murderbot well.

# Plot: 6/9. Tedious. At least it's a story with a conflict.
Murderbot presumed that Asa accidentally bumped into Sekai and knocked her off the platform. (But is this true? Since Elane who was very concerned with Sekai had seemed to have a tiff with Sekai at first.) 

At first Murderbot didn't rescue her because it's not part of its duty. However it changed its mind upon thinking about a similar scene in its ongoing media.

So it saved her and Sekai who at first felt Murderbot creepy were willing to say thanks to it in the end.

# World and others: 6/9. At least it depicts a greedy company striving for the maximum profit in an illogical way.


# Overall: 5/9
The author lacks the talent of writing short fiction.
