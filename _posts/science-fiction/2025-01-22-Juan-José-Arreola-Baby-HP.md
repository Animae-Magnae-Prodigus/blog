# Plot: 4/9. As an advertisement for imaginary gadget called Baby HP and as a satire on hysterical babies with convulsive tantrums, it didn't have any visible plot rather than a series of funny scenes.
+ It could turn exhausting bustle of children into exhilarating energy of electricity.
+ Large family could even run small business out of their children.
+ It contributed to children's harmonious development according to experts.
+ Sugary diets were recommended for better investment returns.
+ children should wear the gadget everywhere day and night even at school.


# Core: 2/9. I don't think this article criticized consumerism. It just used the form of advertisements to satirize on children's excessive power. Maybe Arreola once had to tend some arbitrary child?


# Characters: 1/9. The only character existed in this story was the narrator actually. What do you expect from an advertisement?


# World and Others: 0/9. What do you expect from an advertisement?



# Overall: 2/9. To be honest, this is not a feasible story but an unprocessed idea.
