# Plot: ?/9. I dump it after the completion of chapter 2, about 25% of the whole context.
Annie was Doug's custom-made sex robot and gained her consciousness through the autodidactic mode. One day Doug's best friend Rolland called upon them unexpectedly just to invite Doug to serve as his best man of his wedding. Rolland was so amazed at the existence of Annie and he even seduced Annie into having sex with him and persuaded her to keep it as a secret.
Annie rejected Rolland's sexual intercourse the second time, because she thought she had already had a secret to make her more like a real woman.

At Rolland's recommendation, Annie began to fancy programming. But her mechanic considered this hobby as a treat to her performance and managed her to abandon that.
Annie's incapacity for housework annoyed Doug so much that Doug eventually brought home another robot specifically to do the cleaning despite Annie's jealous protest.
Doug didn't want anyone to know that he was mating with his sex doll and therefore he ordered Annie a phone pal service to pretend herself as a normal woman even in front of the newcomer's eye.
He reproached harshly Annie, after he coldly refused the interview purposed by the company for the sake of his privacy and Annie criticized his attitude.

(Reason for dumping:
+ The autodidactic was dangerous because the owner couldn't control the information being fed to the robots. The only safeguard was merely clearing the memory and the only monitor means was to ask the robot, which showed the weakness of the worldview. It would have helped if Sierra Greer had researched the modern programming and developing on robots instead of just projecting the psychology of a real woman onto the robot unnaturally and lazily.
+ The plot was so tedious up to now and the characters were unlovable to empathize with.
+ I find Annie's purposes, emotions and capabilities laughable. For example, if she didn't want to displease her owner, why did she criticise her owner's lack of politeness? Did she think she has the privilege to judge a human?
+ All in all, there is nothing attractive in any element of this work.
