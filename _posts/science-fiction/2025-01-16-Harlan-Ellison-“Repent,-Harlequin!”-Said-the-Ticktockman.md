# Plot: 4/9. It's a flimsy fairytale with  poor narrating, because Ellison didn't explain how Harlequin got so many jellybeans, how Harlequin was caught, weather Alice told him out or not, what moved Harlequin to do those gimmicks, how his death influenced the society or how this society was so irredeemable that it didn't change. So I think it a bit superficial yet funny.



# Core: 4/9. One way to judge whether your nation is tyranny or not is to see whether the top tier obey the same rules they set for the lower. 



# Character: 3/9. I cannot resonate with most of characters. They are all actually boilerplate without character arcs. 
```
Ticktockman = bad tyrant
joker = good rebel
```

# World and Others: 2/9. How could everyone believe it reasonable to relate unpunctuality with death? How could Ticktockman know whether a person was punctual or not in their private affairs? Did there exist any opportunity to appeal?

# Overall: 3/9. I think it just a little more funny than Paul Scheerbart's The New Overworld. Like Vonnegut, I prefer Ellison's writing skill to his world-building. They three are the same type of writers I mildly dislike.
