# Plot: 4/9. It's a unique love story.
The narrator, Bo, Lou, Muse, and Kelly came down in Paris. Kelly banged the door of a pissoir. One of five men inside it asked them, Spacer, to leave. The narrator wondered whether they were frelk. He said no.

They then flied to Houston and a kind couple were willing to carry Spacers for Spacers worked for the government. Lou wondered whether they were frelks. The narrator thought no.

They came to Mexico where whores turned out for the fishermen. Spacers yelled and broke the window, while fishermen and whores laughed at them. Then a woman on the telegraph office asked the narrator to leave. The narrator wondered whether she was frelk. She said no.

They then flied to Istanbul. Kelly said she had to hunt up a rich frelk due to lack of money. Bo told them he once beat two people dressing like Spacers to pick up frelks. They spent the day apart.

The narrator was greeted by a woman who recognized him as a Spacer. She said as a poor student, she didn't have money, so it's okay if the narrator turned around. But the narrator felt money was not that important and stayed.

She felt sorry for the narrator's fate that the government neutered them for the sake of space exploration. The narrator explained gonads didn't work right under high radiation and the population needed to be controlled in this age.

The woman professed that she was a perverted frelk worshipping Spacers.

> My love starts with the fear of love.

> I want you because you can't want me.

The narrator asked her to give them something valuable but she rejected because she didn't want to buy them. Finally, the narrator agreed to go to her house without money.

The narrator asked what she would give them because they was lonely. She confessed she was lonely too, but things she wanted from the narrator was impossible to realize. The narrator asked her to pay them anything. She asked them to leave. Before they left, she told them a popular Spacer hangout.

The narrator went there and met their friend. Kelly was paid 150 lira.

# Core: 4/9. I thought Gomorrah meant the government who neutered Spacers and forced them to abandon or misunderstand the normal love.
Spacers were neutered by the government to do space work. So they would ask money for those who had a complex on them, because they were stripped of the sensation of love and also their working condition was not suitable for a long-lasting relationship. But this time, the narrator met a girl wanting this kind of mundane relationship with a Spacer. That's impossible!

No wonder, in the end, they were both lonely, but they cannot satisfy others, for their requirements were unmatched. The reason why narrator kept asking for not money but valuable things was because they still could not sense or understand the abstract but valuable love the girl already gave or intended to give.




# Character: 3/9. Their dialogue were so tedious and their psychological activities were so obscure.



# World and Others: 4/9. It had many places inside but the environmental depiction was not good enough. I could not sense precisely anything from the broke and quickly changing environment.



# Overall: 4/9. Delany is not my cup of tea but I wouldn't reject his work.
