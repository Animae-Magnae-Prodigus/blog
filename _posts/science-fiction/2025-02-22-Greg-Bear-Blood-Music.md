# Plot: 5/9. 

Edward, an obstetrician, gave Vergil Ulam, his talented friend met in the university, an ultrasound scan and a blood test without official notice. Both the sheath-like, interlocking patterns on Vergil's bones and the diagnosis of infection convinced Edward that Vergil had experimented upon himself with a myriad of autonomous microscopic electrochemical computers capable of evolving themselves under duress of being sacked by his company, Genetron Corp, and losing all his work.

In these days, those incredible Medically Applicable Biochips not only rebuilt him from the inside out by restoring his health, fixing up the metabolism and reinforcing the bones as well as libido, but also probably helped him return to the laboratory and made rapid advances in his career.

Being terrified by the nightmarish catastrophes Vergil brought to bear on the civilisation of humanity in the possible future, especially after witnessing how they are talking to Vergil by interacting with his neurons directly, Edward dunked the quartz lamp that was used to forbidding them crawling outside the skin into the tub where Vergil was releasing his intrepid, tiny astronauts, and subsequently electrocuted Vergil on the spur of the moment, only to make for a long-lasting, thorough, disastrous, anatomical transformation on him and his wife 
by the unnoticed exodus and eventually to become an immense pool of cells draping across the apartment that would likely pollute the water and intrude all the living things on Earth.


































































































# Core: 6/9. Since the ultraviolet could apparently annihilate them, why did Edward worry about the prospect of the humanity so much without proper deliberation about the pros and cons of the burgeoning technology with his old friend?
To my way of thinking, Edward was absolutely more lunatic and bloody than credulous Vergil, and was created intentionally here to spice up the context sans profound research on the social conflicts which this envisioned technology would really give rise to.



# Character: 3/9. 



# World and Others: 6/9. 



# Overall: 5/9.
