# Plot: 5/9. 

Edward, an obstetrician, gave Vergil Ulam, his talented friend met in the university, an ultrasound scan and a blood test without official notice. The sheath-like, interlocking patterns on Vergil's bones, along with the diagnosis of infection, convinced Edward that Vergil had experimented upon himself with a myriad of autonomous, microscopic, electrochemical computers capable of evolving themselves under duress of being sacked by his company, Genetron Corp, and losing all his work.

In these days, the incredible Medically Applicable Biochips not only rebuilt him from the inside out by restoring his health, fixing up his metabolism and reinforcing his bones as well as libido, but also virtually helped him return to the laboratory and would make rapid advances and splendid success in his career.

Being terrified by the nightmarish catastrophes Vergil could bring to bear on the civilisation of humanity in the possible future—especially after witnessing how Vergil were talking to them through his neurons with a beatific facial expression—Edward dunked the quartz lamp that (which was used to forbid them crawling outside the skin) into the tub where Vergil was releasing his intrepid, tiny astronauts, and therefore electrocuted Vergil on the spur of the moment, only to make for a long-lasting, thorough, disastrous, anatomical transformation in both Edward and his wife by the unnoticed exodus from the Vergil's body, and eventually to become an immense pool of cells draping across the apartment that would likely pollute water bodies and threaten all the other living things on Earth.

# Core: 6/9. Since the ultraviolet light could apparently annihilate them, why did Edward worry about the prospect of the humanity so much without proper deliberating over the pros and cons of this burgeoning technology with his old friend?
To my way of thinking, Edward was absolutely more lunatic and bloody than the credulous Vergil, and was created intentionally here to spice up the context sans profound exploration on the social conflicts this envisioned technology would really give rise to.

# Character: 3/9. 

# World and Others: 6/9. 

# Overall: 5/9.
