# Plot: 5/9. 
Dr. Gothon, an honorable scientist of a quarter of a million years old, demonstrated her theory with circumstantial evidences of newly excavated pots, fossils and concrete  supporting statistics to the fifth lord-navigator Desan that the sapient species on this planet they landed now had been exterminated long time ago incapable to escape from the catastrophic atomics.

Desan didn't believe this revelation would incur their demise envisioned by these terrified scientists and therefor sent the message to five magistrates, only to get the anticipated murder aiming for their silence.

Fortunately, Desan had a more competitive space military dealing with other magistrates without his particular commands, but he himself was deeply injured in doing away with their enemies' AI vehicle. 

At last, scientists who prepared well for this foreseeable civil war survived the raid and saved dying Desan in time, but Desan insisted to continue his voyage of seeking for the dreamlike civilisation whose message they once received a quarter of million years ago and consequently bade farewell to Gothon and other scientists who were determined to inhabit on this planet.

# Core: 5/9. Would it be better if the purpose of their expedition was revealed at first?
The storyline of getting involved into a conspired rebellion for the sake of truth was interesting yet not engaging, because I could not understand at first why debunking a faulty supposition would cause such an intense reaction, what did the tale of this planet really mean to these spacefarers in the future, and what kind of high stake would the five magistrates lose that pushed them to annihilate their own colleagues.
Compared with [Asimov's Nightfall]({{ site.Baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-11-16-Isaac-Asimov-Nightfall %}),—also an alien civilisation finding their entrenched belief was a lie—this work with an extremely limited third-person perspective failed to render proper emotions or wonders for empathy or anticipation, though it indeed showed much flair for Cherryh's fabulous world building.

# Character: 6/9. I was a little touched by the archaeologist who put the relics of a girl with her pet together in the gallery and wondered what had Gothon—the memorable and venerable woman who schemed and hosted the final report successfully—initially felt at the moment when she discovered the vanity of a project which she had witnessed from the beginning and devoted all her passions to.

# World and Others: 5/9. 
I expected more marvelous deductions or details of this lost civilisation and the dramatic space war especially on the aspect of killing the five magistrates at one time with some state-of-the-art futuristic technology other than the mundane scene of fighting against the clumsy AI vehicle.

# Overall: 5/9.
