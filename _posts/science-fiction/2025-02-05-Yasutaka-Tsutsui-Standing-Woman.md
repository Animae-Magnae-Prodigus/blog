# Plot: 4/9. The plot was bland because of the passive narrator who didn't do anything but accepting the status quo.
The narrator finished his story without any practical meaning except merely entertainment. On his way to post office, he met a stranger feeding the pillar of a dog, which was made from the living creature and still held some properties of animals before they completely transformed into the plant. That stranger confessed mournfully that he used to be a writer but now he didn't have any courage to continue his writing in an era where even a casual conversation here between them two strangers might be reported, because two writers assembled together would be seen as an illegal assembly.

After bidding farewell to the elderly writer, he gave his mail to a pillar of a postman who was made just owing to his complaint of low wage being heard by the boss. 

Eventually, the narrator came to visit the pillar of his wife who was made because of her criticism on the government to promote the narrator's fame. Her wife begged him to forget about her and never check her again so that she could turn to a complete tree as soon as possible and he either didn't took the risk of being reported for his illegal behavior of calling the old name of a pillar.

In a small coffee bar, students were talking about a critic and his supporters who were just made into a bunch of pillars by the government.



# Core: 6/9. I thought the writer used the love tragedy between the narrator and the standing woman to make a clandestine innuendo to the brutality of Japan in his era. I indeed resonate with that sentimentality of incapable of doing anything to save any one you cherished including your wife under autocracy.



# Character: 7/9. I was impressed by the elderly writer that abandoned his writing because of fear, the postman who fulfilled his duty even after the involuntary mutation, the overseer who chose to go away silently at the lovers' reunion, the students who couldn't help talking about another tragedy in the public and the star-crossed couple. Tsutsui succeeded in depicting the behaviors of people living under autocracy through an absurd presumption.



# World and Others: 4/9. I would give a higher score if the cause and the structure of the government and the technique were depicted with more details.



# Overall: 5/9. Tsutsui was worth noting despite my distaste towards an incapable protagonist.
