# Plot: 3/9. It's not so much a complete story as an undeveloped satire, because there merely existed three main scenes here in want of concrete information on alien's baffling entanglement with men in the past.
## 1
After Jack left home, his alien wife Susie took advantage of his vacancy to invite Maggie, another alien housewife whose husband had escaped far away from her owing to her natural scent on must, into their own intrinsic consummation. But Maggie refused to produce a baby with Susie, claiming men would undoubtedly kill their babies had they dare to reproduce.

## 2
Susie remembered her name as if struck by a bolt out of the blue sky and thus tried to instigate a rebellion among other wives, which was opposed by conservatives who held the initial memory how they abandoned themselves at men's disposal and worried the possibility that man would bring that extreme violence back to their whole species as long as one renegade appeared. 

## 3
So to further their thorough submission to their masters, aliens executed Susie and substituted her absence with another housewife who Jack was unable to tell the difference from the original.



# Core: 6/9. The core was indeed thought-provoking yet blemished by the undeveloped plot and world building.
This story revolved around a peculiar setting reminiscent of a comment made by a feminist on the culture of the homosexual rape among heterosexual males in the prison and rapists' humiliating reference to the victims as "women":
> Female were not only a physical phenomenon, but also a social condition.

By the way, one could also learn from this tiny work that the existence of autocracy was inseparable from the compromise of most people, who were accordingly not that innocent because of their potential connivance of the evil's trample on the good.



# Character: 2/9. Why do female characters under most of the female writers' pen in this anthology always exhibit some features of tedious passivity and ludicrous obedience without engaging in any serious struggle against their enemy or destiny?
For instance, just after the last moment when Susie encouraged people to hide and rebel against men, she immediately took the acceptance of being disposed of by the conservatives in favour of men's dominance for granted, ridiculously dispensing herself with an honorable fight for liberation that might evoke more people to follow her example.



# World and Others: 3/9. The world building was impressive yet unconvincing sans circumstantial details from the perspective of mine.



# Overall: 4/9.
