# Plot: 7/9. Darkness was abnormal to people except the blind who accordingly helped lots of people due to their adaptability to the darkness.
When Waldas went home in the afternoon, electrical appliances were on the blink. He woke up in the morning, only to find the darkness was pervasive including the sun that seemed to be behind a thick smoked glass. Then Waldas helped his neighbor to feed his family and they temporarily formed a group of five in the apocalypse.

Waldas volunteered to replenish their resources, but he found nothing and even lost his way in the pall of darkness. In desperation, a blind called Vasco of the institute for the blind answered his mayday and led him home to adopt Vasco's group in the remuneration of Waldas' water. 

Soon for the lack of supplies, they took refuge on the Farm that the institute owed miles away. However, the reserve here only sufficed to support them another 16 days or so. Luckily, at the morning of the eighteenth day, things turned back to normal.

Waldas returned to the city where the military had already came back to recover the order, contacted with his brother-in-law, and went home.



# Core: 4/9. So why did the world totally fall into absolute blackness that even the matches or fine would not work? What about phosphorescence? I would give a higher score if the details on the cause of darkness were given.



# Character: 3/9. Mundane. Carneiro should cast more light on the perspective of the blind and the interaction between Waldas and Vasco.



# World and Others: 4/9. At least it depicted how people faced the apocalypse: They had to abandon those useless people owing to the lack of resources.



# Overall: 5/9. Carneiro is worth my attention.
