# Plot: 6/9. The pattern was so predictable like a cheesy video game constantly providing fresh monsters for the player whose only fighting skill was his marvellous strength. Worst of all, the protagonist didn't seem to really get into a crucial trouble that fully demonstrated himself through his own solution, which was extremely noticeable considering the crudeness of the other writing elements.
1. Cassandra bantered the birthday of her lover before foretelling that the protagonist would change things.
2. The protagonist inadvertently let out the secret of his old age incompatible with his young appearance. Cassandra then accurately reminisced about the past feat of the protagonist's namesake, a Returnist who had bombed resorts. Before boarding the air taxi, Cassandra omened the protagonist would come across some sort of danger.
3. He met his ex-girlfriend Ellen who told him to go to the library for his mission. Ellen asked him to persuade her husband, jcj to stop indulging himself in his bugs.
4. His old friend Phil was asked to run interference for him. His boss lorel Sands commanded him to guide Cort Myshtigo around Earth, who seemed to realise the protagonist's anomalous age before insulting Phil's work. Their first encounter was therefore so unpleasant that the protagonist accused him of lacking the compassion abounding in his well-known grandpa.
5. In the library, Myshtigo conducted the concrete route of his sightseeing tour all over Earth. Don Dos Santos, the current secretary of Radpol, a radical group once founded by the protagonist, offered to protect the alien from the possible murder of his comrades along with his partner Diane and employed bodyguard Hasan. George requested to go along with them for the sake of his breakthrough research about the extirpation of spiderbat. Finally, the alien beseeched the protagonist to take him to a ceremony of voodoo, which the protagonist obliged.
6. In the ceremony, Hasan was possessed by a God who only favoured murderers or killers. So the protagonist sounded out whether his himself was Hasan's target by offering a duel, which was rejected by Hasan, because he once witness how the protagonist knocked a boxer down with only bare hands, and therefore swore only to fight against the protagonist from a distance afterwards. Hasan claimed he was hired to kill the alien possibly rather than the protagonist, which was contradictory to the protagonist's responsibility as a tour guide.
7. As they arrived at Cairo, Myshtigo told the protagonist he intended to write a travelogue for this journey, since their civilization was exceedingly interested in Earth. Myshtigo didn't agree with Santos's political views, considering the fact that the current generation exiled from Earth to Myshtigo's planet didn't miss their original home, let alone return.
8. The tourists found the great pyramid of Cheops was dismantled under the authorisation of the protagonist for the local material shortage. The protagonist even planned to film the entire process of destructing and run it backwards so as to recreate the possible construction of the pyramid and earn some money. All the other tourists especially Myshtigo were appalled at this kind of sacrilege of the monument.
> "They are desecrating a monument to the past glories of the human race!"
> "Nothing is cheaper than past glories."

> "You are a mad man!"
> "No. The absence of a monument can, in its own way, be something of a monument also."
9. The protagonist thought the grenade was not suitable to handle the dangerous boadile and offered Myshtigo a pistol, which the alien rejected, but wondered how many legs this creature had.
10. The protagonist went berserk and ran amok, upon hearing the bad news that his wife might be wiped out by the unexpected earthquake. After he attacked the other tourists, Hasan sent off his wrestling Rolem with the power five times as much again as the ordinary to stall the demented protagonist. The protagonist beat it down and regained his reason before losing his consciousness.
11. The protagonist took apart Rolem and not yet sure whether Hasan had intentionally killed him.
12. Everyone consoled him except the alien. Although nobody seemed suspected based on their words, he still had a feeling that he was on the death list of someone.
13. In order to save Myshtigo, the protagonist had to confront boadile with bare hands. Hasan killed the creature by throwing his shaft accurately into its artery, and thus saved the protagonist, which puzzled the protagonist about Hasan's real tasks again. Phil wanted to participate in the journey to visit Greek.
14. Diane recognized the protagonist's past identity and therefore confessed to the protagonist that Hasan was hired by them—Radpol, to murder the alien surreptitiously. In fact, Hasan's shot missed his real target—Myshtigo and accidentally rescued the protagonist. Due to Diane's ignorance of the reason the alien deserved the death, the protagonist was determined to refuse the cooperation and safeguard the alien during the entire journey.
15. Myshtigo sensed the protagonist had probed his mind and questioned the protagonist. The protagonist admitted and claimed the alien's motive of travelling was above writing a simple travel book. Myshtigo rejected to leak more information but finally accepted the protagonist's offered gun for self-defence.
16. He returned to Greek, his original home and place where he had initiated the Returnist Rebellion. The hotel room he currently abode had been decorated with enormous embarrassing descriptive, sometimes bogus details to commemorate his past.
17. The protagonist encountered Jason, his old son who had never met his father for nineteen years but came here immediately after he dreamed about the possible danger that might destroy his father: Dead Man who had once drunk the blood of Jason's sheep, a burning stone, Black Beast, and an assassin resembling Hasan. He also mentioned Borton—the dog they once owned—burst out of home to find the protagonist but disappeared since then.
18. The protagonist played the pipe to ask satyrs to keep distance away from them.
19. Diane received no response from the headquarter and informed the protagonist of her final decision in continuing the assassination.
20. The protagonist threatened Hasan to hand off the alien and even insulted him. But Hasan behaved so well that he even told the protagonist that he would never fall into the protagonist's trap and offer the duel on his own.
21. They found an abandoned, deformed baby and the protagonist took himself as an example to demonstrate the accepted custom of infanticide here.
22. Hasan pointed his gun at the alien during his maintenance. Therefore, the protagonist cannot stand the provocation  and offered a duel by himself.
23. The protagonist practiced the sling all night and Hasan reminisced about their past of fighting together for the independence of Earth.
24. The protagonist and Hasan threw stones at each other before they were interrupted by a batch of Kouretes.
25. Shaman of Kouretes, a researcher accepting Returnism to observe the indigenous tribe, demanded his prisoners to choose one person to fight against allegedly unbeatable Dead Man.
26. They recognized Dead Man was actually an albino with Down's Syndrome manipulated by Shaman from birth as a toy for bloody ceremony, so Hasan fought him with the assistance of Magnesium flare.
27. The protagonist and Hasan delayed the enemy to help others escape.
28. The barbarian caught them both and tied them on the burning stones in a valleys. Borton saved them in time at the moment when Shaman was about to gut them.
29. The protagonist asked Borton to bring friends to release them after it massacred all their enemies.
30. A Satyr remembering the protagonist passed by coincidentally and answered his petition.
31. They headed for the protagonist's hometown Volos and slept in a cave.
32. In Volos, old Phil died sound in his dream. Myshtigo declared the end of this tour promptly because he got enough information and didn't have much time left.
33. Phil's last letter begged the protagonist to protect the alien off Earth, as Phil knew from Myshtigo's grandfather that although Myshtigo suffered incurable disease, he was going to carry out a plan of returning Earth and conserving its invaluable culture. So the protagonist bade farewell to the guests and incinerated Phil. But the smell attracted Black Beast which all of them was unable to defeat.
34. Cassandra, somehow escaping the disaster, saved them in time.
35. The protagonist set up an opposition party to Radpol, before he was informed that Myshtigo bought Earth from the expatriate Earth government and bequeathed it to the protagonist. Myshtigo's real goal was to check whether the protagonist, an immortal with high survival potential, was qualified as the owner of Earth.



# Core: 4/9. This work is not so much science fiction as apocalyptic Greek Mythology, featuring a mediocre adventure about a godlike protagonist fighting against mutants whose appearance coincided with the lore on godforsaken Earth. In the end, like all the other heroes in those antediluvian tales, the protagonist was suitably rewarded with Earth for his mettle and effort.
Although this work was favoured by Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1966 tying with Dune, I agreed partially with the opinion of Lawrence Ashmead, an editor who rejected this book for publishing and claimed that "the plot was terribly thin and uninteresting" with the "Germanic constructions and pseudo clever dialogue". 




# Character: 5/9. At least Zelazny made some side characters distinctive enough like the arrogant alien, the sentimental poet, the sly assassin and the idiosyncratic scientist.
In contrast, the protagonist lived long but seemed like a teenager who lacked calmness, reserve, patience and wisdom too much to wait for the enemy's weaknesses.
+ He got so deranged upon hearing the bad news that he even attacked his accompanies.
+ He didn't warn the alien properly about the danger hibernated around him after soliciting the information.
+ He offered the duel so hot-headedly that even the alien didn't understand their reason for the duel.



# World and Others: 4/9. Combining the Greek mythology into the worldview scientifically was one of the advantages of this book, though from the hindsight, Zelazny needed to polish this part better to create a convincing world.
> Do you not see a convergence of life and myth here during the last days of life on this planet?
