# Plot: 5/9. This is a sarcastic and funny conte de philosophy in the form of an open letter from Tichy to appeal to the environmental protection by depicting the various malignant anthropic influence for the cosmic. Here are the phenomena he had a dig at:
+ graffiti, carve, and emulsion left by tourists and photographers
+ gone planetoids for souvenirs
+ trash thrown all around the space
+ spitting into the space 
+ alcoholism
+ overdrive
+ outrage sanitary conditions
+ public conveniences
+ picking flowers and cutting trees
+ children kicking objects 
+ hunting foreign species for meals
+ the negligence of maintaining the road signs
+ loud music and loud voices
+ sharp light of cameras
+ the extinction of species


# Core: 8/9. What if people could travel around the universe? Don't they harm the environment as usual since people are always anthropocentric and no authority is able to supervise them? It's funny and comedic, yet I would give a higher score if the species here were realistic rather than superficial.



# Character: 5/9. Tichy was an admiring and thoughtful writer. This article was not aim at characters. However, I still remember that "considerable" employee.
> Some people believe it's all right if humans eat creatures from other planets, but when the reverse takes place they raise a hue and cry, call for military assistance, demand punitive expeditions, etc.

> Why is it proper for a human to pick flowers and dry them in a herbarium, but unnatural for a plant to tear off and preserve ears?

# World and Others: 4/9. Fauna and fungi here were just created for the core. If they were that smart, they would not be so harmless or the human would be more concerned. But it's indeed a hilarious  comic world.



# Overall: 6/9. Works like that often lose their charm at the second read.
