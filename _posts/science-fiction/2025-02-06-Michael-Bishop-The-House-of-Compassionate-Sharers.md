# Plot: 3/9. Bishop's redemption arc tasted flat, failing to possess any impressive appeal of a Bishop to touch the right chord.
Dorian Lorca, the narrator and the prince consort to the governor of Miroste, Rumai Montieth, was introduced to Kefa, the only wardress at the house of compassionate sharers as Montieth's last hope to extinguish her husband's anthrophobia and suicide attempt owing to having to survive in the form of cyborg after an accident.

After an embarrassing conversation in the vehicle, Lorca arrived at the house where Kefa announced three rules which were impertinent here, for as would be demonstrated in the subsequent context, guests could be punished even when they didn't violate one of them obviously.

Lorca's sharer arranged by Kefa was a more thoroughly transformed yet dumb cyborg. He served well as a toy capable of dutifully executing Lorca's every command except killing the bird.

After watching the rude twins asking for their own sharer, Lorca confessed to his own taciturn sharer that he constantly dallied with some other women to arouse his wife's sexual jealousy in the past. 

After being mistaken as one of sharers by the twins, Lorca continued to recall his wife and slept safe and sound under the hand of his sharer for the first time.

In the night, upon hearing Kefa's cry for help, Lorca, led by his sharer, hurried to rescue Kefa from the twin. When he saw how Kefa consoled a person whose artificial eye was vandalized by the twins, he underwent a shift in perspective, adapted himself to his new body and felt an inexplicable motivation to be one of the compassionate sharers.

So after having accompanied his wife throughout her entire life, he applied to the house as a novitiate.


# Core: 2/9. The story of redemption usually required a tighter storyline on how the protagonist gradually accepted the exotic part in himself and more charismatic characters to edify the protagonist for his ultimate climax of epiphany and transcendence. This is why the article was an absolute failure:
+ Characters lacked depth: What is the background of all the other compassionate sharers? Why were they seemed as expensive commodities rather than human? Why did they volunteer to do such a dangerous and humiliating job?
+ Climax was not striking: I would give a higher score if the protagonist could get acquainted with more distinct compassionate sharers, ultimately leading him to beating the crazy twins by accepting his true self and overcoming his old terror.
+ Conflicts were mild and solutions were haphazard: I don't think normal people could fully resonate with the protagonist's gradual acceptance and final metamorphosis.



# Character: 2/9. The only character bearing some resemblance to a live human was the protagonist despite his undecipherable metamorphosis.



# World and Others: 4/9. At least Bishop depicted the appearance of the house in good details.


# Overall: 3/9. Could it represent Bishop's true level or just another mistake made by Vandermeer? After all, this big book was abundant in unqualified articles.
