# Plot: 3/9. Bishop's bland redemption story clearly didn't possess any impressive appeal of a Bishop to touch the right chord.
Dorian Lorca, the narrator and the prince consort of the governor of Miroste, Rumai Montieth, was introduced to Kefa, the only wardress of the house of compassionate sharers as Montieth's last hope to extinguish her husband's anthrophobia and suicide attempt owing to having to survive in the form of cyborg because of an accident.

After an embarrassing chat on the vehicle, Lorca arrived to the house where Kefa announced three rules which was not important here, for as would demonstrate in the next context, guests could be punished even they didn't violate one of them.

Lorca's sharer arranged by Kefa was a more thoroughly transformed yet dumb cyborg. He served well as a toy capable of dutifully executing Lorca's every command except killing the bird.

After watching the rude twins asking for their own sharer, Lorca confessed to his own taciturn sharer that he constantly dallied with some other women to arouse his wife's sexual jealousy in the past. 

In the night, after he sound Kefa's cry for help, led by his sharer, he hurried to rescue Kefa from the twin. When he saw how Kefa consoled the man whose artificial eye was vandalized by the twins, he suddenly adapted himself and felt the urge to be one of the compassionate sharers.

So after he accompanied his wife through her entire life, he applied to the house as a novitiate.


# Core: 2/9. The salvage story required a tighter storyline on how the protagonist gradually accepted the exotic part of himself and more resonating characters to edify the protagonist for his ultimate climax of epiphany and transcendence. This is why the article was an absolute failure:
+ Characters had no depth: What is the background of all the compassionate sharers? Why were they seemed as expensive commodities rather than human? Why did they volunteer to do such a dangerous and humiliating job?
+ Climax was not striking: I would give a higher score if the protagonist could get acquainted with more compassionate sharers and beat the crazy twins under the assistance of his new friends.
+ Conflicts were mild and solution was a haphazard event: I don't think normal people could resonate with the protagonist's decision to accept himself.



# Character: 2/9. The only character sensed a bit like a human was the protagonist despite his undecipherable logic and obscure intention. 



# World and Others: 3/9. At least Bishop depicted the appearance of the house in good but unnecessary details.


# Overall: 3/9. Could it represent Bishop's true level or just another mistake made by Vandermeer? After all, this big book was full of unqualified articles.
