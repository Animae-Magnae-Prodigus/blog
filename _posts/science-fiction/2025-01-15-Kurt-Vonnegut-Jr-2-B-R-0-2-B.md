# Plot: 6/9. It's a concise dark drama as powerful as a short film.
## Prologue
+ This is a perfect swell world with no cripples, poverty, prisons, wars, old age and disease. And the population America was stabilized at 40 million.

## first scene
+ Wehling was waiting for his wife to give birth to his triplets in an empty hospital.

+ A sardonic painter was redecorating the mural about people packing a very neat garden.

+ A orderly came singing a popular song on euthanasia for love.
+ He pointed out Hitz, the chief obstetrician, in the prominent location of the painting.
+ 2BR02B was the line for euthanasia.
+ The painter thought the life like a foul cloth. But he didn't intend to neither suicide now nor suicide by the normal euthanasia program.

## second scene
+ Duncan, the hostess of the euthanasia posing to be drawn, picked out a place beside Hitz on the painting satisfyingly.
+ She felt so honorable because Hitz was the first person who had set up the gas chamber.

## third scene
+ Hitz came and flirted with Duncan.
+ Hitz also declared Wehling's hard choice between infanticide and suicide.

+ Wehling said he was unhappy to have to change his grandpa's life for one of his babies and decide which two of triplets had to be killed.
+ Hitz then moralized about his attitude on population control and made a speech on its significance.

## solution and climax
+ Wehling shot Hitz, Duncan and himself to make rooms for his triplet.

## final scene
+ The painter who watched everything decided to terminate his life with Wehling's gun, but he eventually turned to the 2BR02B for help.
+ The recipient thanked him directly without further ado and necessary investigation.

# Core: 3/9. Wehling could have done lots of things during the pregnancy, yet he chose the dramatic remedy for the sake of the plot. Wehling responded Hitz with only his requirements like an automatic machine rather than an intelligent human, which makes me extremely hard to resonate with his motivation, behavior, and the core of the work.
I think it showed that the selfishness, greed and chutzpa of people like Wehling were the true bane of making the world an unsuitable place. Even if they don't worry about death, they still want more. If they cannot get in normal way, they did in the violate way.

So it impossible for the improvement of technology alone to annihilate violence, because people like Wehling are willing to kill others for their own profit no matter how many things they already have.


# Character: 3/9. They're all driven by the plot. Since the title was quoted from Hamlet, why not build the hero against Hamlet on the quintessential question? I would give a higher score if Vonnegut stated more clearly about his purpose.



# World and Others: 1/9. It's a cold and frivolous world. I'm more interested in how scientists were able to get rid of diseases and old age. Next time, I will never read sci-fi with this ridiculous opening.


# Overall: 3/9. I hesitate to read more works on Vonnegut, for I like his mature writing skill but dislike his lack of depth and world-building.
