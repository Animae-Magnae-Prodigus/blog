# Plot: 4/9. Tawdry. A black poor man who knew how to call for help saved a white rich woman who knew only crying for help. Thriller? Adventure? Fight? Nothing! Only enormous craps on how the woman felt the man. I would give a higher score if this was ended with the part of two and the return of bigotry because a happy ending flushes the serious core.
People were talking about the comet. President asked Jim, the messenger, to go down into the lower vaults for old records. Not only did he find lost records in the cavern but also gold in a rusty crust. 

Suddenly the great stone closed, so he searched for the switch, only to find vault clerk's dead corpse outside. He wanted to call guards but death lay everywhere including the bank and the entire Wall Street. Newspaper told him that comet's tail swept past them at noon and brought deadly gas everywhere. 

He came to a famous hostelry and ate food from dead hands, then get a car to search for survivors. He heard a cry from a white woman from the upper class. She had been shut up in the darkroom for pictures of the comet before she came out finding all the dead. She left a note for her father, an officer worked in the Metropolitan Tower. They went to Harlem where Jim found he lost everybody. Then they found her father had gone for a hundred-mile spin in Fred's new Mercedes.

They went to central telephone exchange where the woman felt terrible at the fact that the long-distance telephone didn't work out. He knew how to call help by cable but the station was drown by water. 

They came back to her father's office to send rockets, and they got their reply. Her father and her boyfriend, Fred, appeared to get her, Julia. She told her prejudiced father that Jim saved her. Her father then gave him a roll of bills to thank him. They were informed that they were the only two survivors in the New York city. 

He took out a baby's filmy cap from his pocket and a brown woman carrying a dead dark baby called his name and jumped into his arms.


# Core: 3/9. The apocalypse was the comet bringing lethal gas in New York City and only those in basements survived it. I don't understand the correlation between comet and gas. But I gave some score to the idea that black lives matter.



# Character: 2/9. I would give a higher score if the woman here was not merely a vase whose only usage was crying for help. What did you expect from a male writer born in 19th century even if he was black?



# World and Others: 1/9. It was set in New York city. Why had the newspaper already published the news but still only two people survived the apocalypse? It would be more efficient to notify people aloud on street. Did the news agency want the exclusive news at this moment?



# Overall: 3/9.
