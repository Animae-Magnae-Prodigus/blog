# Plot: 4/9. Crazy Love?
A alien arrived in the park where Marion's husband always passed by on his way home. Marion worried at her husband's abnormal postponement until she heard the alien used the voice of her husband calling her name. So she ran to the park immediately where the police told her that her husband was eaten by the venom-like alien which was luring her persistently. She was enchanted by her husband's evocation and therefore went into the body of the monster regardless of her own life, impediments of others and human's weapons against the monster.



# Core: 1/9. What did you expect any deep meaning from the idiot plot?



# Character: 1/9. At least it depicted characters.



# World and Others: 1/9. At least it depicted scenes.



# Overall: 0/9. I guess this might inspired Marvel's Venom somehow.
> The symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing Spider-Man #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988).
