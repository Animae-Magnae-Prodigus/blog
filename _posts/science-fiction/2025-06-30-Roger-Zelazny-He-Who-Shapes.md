# Plot: 3/9. Why do people like boring scenes and abstruse themes?
 1. The protagonist, a psychotherapist who could control patients' dreams, diagnosed that his patient's unreasonable concern of his assassination derided from the fact that, as a politician, he subconsciously wanted others' extreme emotions towards him. After that, he agreed to help Eileen, a congenital blind novice, to accommodate her mind into visual impression and thus become a qualified therapist.
2. Along with her speaking and loyal dog, Eileen accepted the protagonist's first therapy.
3. The protagonist learned that a student probing an ape's mind ended in being possessed by it. A professor warned him to stay away from this patient holding intense emotion and strong desire of dominating her dream for the sake of his own safety, which he dismissed. But the protagonist's girlfriend Jill decided to pretend as Eileen's patient so as to persuade her.
4. After the second treatment, Jill was asked by her dog to check Eileen's mentality who seemed to have been disturbed by Jill's visit. To console distraught Eileen, the protagonist treated her the third time but was devoured by the unstable woman eventually.


# Core: 4/9. Changing others' mind by entering their dreams at the cost of operators' own lives was not a rare theme. It would be better if Zelazny analyzed the technology from the perspective of science and technology so that it would be more convincing and the final scene would be more dramatic.



# Character: 4/9. The existence of talking dog improved my score. Good boy!




# World and Others: 4/9.
