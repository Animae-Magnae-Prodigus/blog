# Plot: 7/9. It had a tint of religious story promoting a sublimation from the clumsy terrestrial husk.
Kent Fowler, head of Dome No. 3, Jovian Survey Commission, sent Allen to accept the conversion from homo sapiens made of carbon to Loper, a Jovian life form made of ammonia.

The experiment went smooth, but Allen did not came back to Dome like the previous four participants. Feeling himself scourged by guilt especially after Stanley had accused him of killing people endlessly to fulfill his own ambition and also wondering what's wrong with the project, he decided to convert himself along with his old dog Towser.

This conversion turned out to be a transcendence:
+ He sensed the originally hellish environment was turned into a serene heaven.
+ Towser could telepathize with him for the first time that it was no longer bothered with its ancient punk body.
+ They moved swifter than ever.
+ Fowler could now analyze and distinguish more colors.
+ Towser got the epiphany of vibration and Fowler also suddenly realized how to make the metal against the pressure of Jupiter.
+ They all concluded their original terrestrial poor-equipped bodies stymied them to know the true knowledge.

They felt homo sapiens filthy and expected to explore the new world immediately with deep exhilaration. Therefore they determined not to come back temporarily for fear of being forced to their original state.

# Core: 5/9. Are human still human when they are converted to other species?
In this article, the answer would be definitely no: All the six earthlings deserted their original duty immediately and did not concern human affairs at all, once they were converted to a higher life form.

However, why did human appear to know nothing about Jovian's high intelligence and telepathy, after they did research thoroughly and even created a machine of conversion? How did they do it with this strange ignorance?


# Character: 4/9. Enough to tell a story.
I do not understand why Stanley blamed Fowler alone for there were also other Domes on the planet. 



# World and Others: 8/9. I love the spectacular environmental description on Dome and two distinct perspectives of the same harsh Jovian environment, reminding me a little of Theodore Sturgeon and Stanislaw Lem.



# Overall: 6/9. I think Simak's work are worth my attention and I'm looking forward to read his *City* that incorporated this article.
