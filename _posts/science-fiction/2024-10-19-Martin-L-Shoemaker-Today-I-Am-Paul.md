# Core: 4/9. So-so. A robot caretaker took care of an old woman with Alzheimer's.
Mildred's family added the emulation net, a sophisticated set of neural networks and sensory feedback systems, to a shapeshifting medical care android that records details of people for the caring of Mildred who suffered Alzheimer's both mentally and physically.
The emulation net was based on the empathy net which builds the psychological modules. And "I", the narrative teller, was born to ease the tension between empathy net and emulation net which the company kept it as a secret.


# Character: 3/9. No one was moving and impressive including the robot.
I: a boring/unselfish robot always caring for others and having no thought for itself

Mildred: the old woman with Alzheimer's that I need to take care of

Paul: Mildred's son

Henry: the nurse

Anna: Mildred's daughter

Susan: Paul's wife and Mildred's daughter-in-law who are afraid of the similar fate as Mildred

Millie: Mildred's granddaughter who she didn't recognize actually since she was given birth after she had Alzheimer's

# Plot: 5/9. Slightly good: It depicts well the usage and task of the robot for this family. However, it's a bit tedious to me.
I emulated Paul and torn between the empathy net warning me not to agitate Mildred and the emulation net telling me to represent Paul's argumentative characteristic. I chose the former.

But I followed Paul's pattern and told the fact that Nurse Judy had been died which agitated Mildred who presumed to live in the morning after giving birth to Paul. So I had to coax her by shapeshifting Henry.

Mildred mistook me for Susan and asked the real Susan to get out. I helped her to get out of the embarrassing quandary by letting her enter the room alone and my babysitting Millie at the same time.

I saved Mildred from the firing house but Mildred refused me as a metal monster. This time the empathy net was snubbed and overridden by my concern for her physical health.

The family let Mildred go for her deteriorating condition due to the smoke and burn. I accompanied them to farewell eternally. Susan kept me for fear of the same requirements in the future but now my only role was to act as Mildred at Millie's request.







# World and Others: 3/9. Slightly Bad, but world-building is not the author's priority.
Why don't the company tell others my existence?
What else can the company create based on the similar technology?

# Overall: 4/9. So-so.
If I have to write a novelette with the same topic, I'd like to put more priority to the caring within Mildred's family from a robot's perspective or add more difficulty to the robot's career to spice the plot up.
