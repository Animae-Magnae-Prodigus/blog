# Plot: 4/9.

## Charlie'S Law 3/9. The crisis wasn't dealt by the protagonists.
Charlie was a young survivor of an air crash who had been lived since three year-old near the wreckage by himself until the Antares recently spotted him and delivered him to the Enterprise. It seemed like the boy was an intelligent and energetic troublemaker from the crew of the previous ship. Upon treading the board, Charlie quickly became obsessed with the female escort and tutor called Rand, and he even presented her favorite perfume which Rand didn't know how he got.

The air crash of the Antares and its unfinished death note about Charlie demonstrated a bad omen. Soon, the boy's rude pass to Rand was reported to the captain who decided to teach Charlie unarmed fight so as to quench the youngster's unnecessary libido. However, Charlie got so annoyed at the coach making fun of his failure that he vaporized the coach out of rage and subsequently the armory of guards convened by the alarmed captain. Moreover, he prevented the crew from changing the course or the destination, cut off their communication with the outside ships and threatened to clear out all of them afterward.
Spock, science officer, set Charlie's room as the trap and Rand volunteered to lure him into it. But the trap proved futile. As a revenge, the boy continued to vaporised Rand.

In the end, an alien came to end this farce by returning the crew back and claiming it was they who once gave the boy superpower to rescue him from the famine. Considering his misuse of the irrevocable superpower at present, they finally captured the reluctant boy back.

(So why did the alien capable of communicating with the Enterprise fail to contact any humanity during these passing years? Why did they not feed the boy themselves or create automatic machines instead of endowing him with this uncontrollable superpower?

Judging from the trepid reaction of the boy, I suppose aliens' ulterior motive was to imprison that boy forever with sanctimonious excuses. Therefore they purposely avoided human's contact and didn't teach him knowledge on humanity and custom of his own civilization. So under that supposition, it seemed a bit irresponsible for the Enterprise to connive the aliens' intervention albeit Charlie's notorious mayhem and the alien's plausible maintenance.

It was indeed a complete science-fiction story containing a mystery but violated the common rule of the hero solving the event and some people even claimed the ending as Deus ex machina, which explained my low recommendation. I would give a higher score if the captain had rescued the naughty boy and the boy had experienced some development during the process.)

## Dagger Of The Mind 2/9. The culprit was too easy or too foolish to be defeated.
The Enterprise captured the prisoner at large, whereas its chief doctor McCoy proposed a thorough investigation to the prison judging from the mental condition of the prisoner. (From the prisoner's warnings, it seemed that today's protagonist was Adams, a psychiatric doctor in charge of a prison holding unique method of brainwashing.)

Nothing went wrong during the daily visit and the machine claimed to have deranged the prisoner seemed innocuous at the first sight. It was not until the captain tried the machine himself with the help of his assistant Noel that they proved the machine had the function of brainwashing.

Their operation was observed by Adams who then brainwashed the captain into falling in love with Noel before he imprisoned the two. However, the antagonist foolishly forgot to brainwash Noel for unknown reasons and therefore Noel reminded the captain of the truth. The captain broke the grille for Noel to blackout this area.

When Adams decided to brainwash the captain again, the blackout enabled the captain to knock them down and find Noel after convening the crew to capture Adams, they found Adams died of the machine strangely, possibly either a suicide to evade the punishment or a revengeful homicide committed by his assistant.

## The Real McCoy 4/9. The culprit was too easy to be found.
The Enterprise landed on an archaeological, remote and barren planet to do an annual physical examination for the only two inhabitants hereâ€”a couple called Nancy and Bierce.

A crew member died suddenly during the examination and the only witness Nancy claimed he died of eating the root. However, captain thought it impossible for his experienced crew to eat unknown food, which proved by the report of autopsy showing that there's nothing poisonous within the corpse and the only abnormality was the strange disappearance of the salt.

The culprit became clear as more crew members were falling into the victims with the conspicuous absence of Nancy, which was further confirmed by Bierce that he had been conniving the last alien shape-shifter even after it killed the real Nancy and the crew from the Enterprise.

Finally, Nancy begged the puzzled McCoy to protect her from the captain's killing, and McCoy indeed confronted his crew for her. But after the captain lured it with salt, it couldn't help to show the original appearance.

## The Balance Of Terror 6/9. I was impressed by Spock's excellent analysis, nonchalance towards hostility and suspicion, and eventual execution of his own responsibility before thorough paralysis, though I anticipated more psychological activities from these crew.
Today's protagonist was Romulan who tested their newly developed equipment and weaponry by bombarding the outposts of the federation in the neutral zone. The captain of the Enterprise determined to attack them alone so as to revenge for the outposts as well as to terrorize the Romulan to impede their further invasion towards federation en masse.

They succeeded eventually on both strategy and tactic. Nevertheless, a wife whose wedding ceremony was hosted by the captain just half a day ago became a brand-new widow after this war.

## The Naked Time 5/9. The details of the substance and the antidote should be explored more, or otherwise the solution seemed superficial.
All the complements of the observation station on La Pig had died suspiciously and one of the two Enterprise members who spotted their cadaver went demented suddenly and committed suicide. The acute crumble of the surface of the planet prompted the Enterprise to retreat without further minute investigation.

Soon, crew on board demonstrated the symptom of delirium in series. One of them called Riley thought himself as the captain and blocked their access to the engine room, which became crucial for the Enterprise to avoid the air crash while lifting.

In the end, the doctor found the culprit was the liquid sample brought from the planet that promoted the binding of water within body and contaminated others through perspiration and thus saved the day by injecting the antidote to the ventilator.

## Miri 2/9. The solution was just the doctor's monologue without other protagonists' highlights, especially the captain, who played just as a stubborn idiot here missing the opportunity to save their lives as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the antagonists and the trouble weren't tricky enough, and ergo the plot was tedious. Finally, after the initial assumption of pestilence by the doctor, I couldn't believe the captain still dared to risk all of their lives without any decent protections or cautious precautions against the worst conditions, which further deteriorated the portrait of the captain within my mind. This adaption was absolutely worse than the original.
The Enterprise received an ancient SOS signal and decided to visit this seemingly desolate and post-apocalyptic planet. They found the only survivors were kids and collected its history from a girl called Miri, before she found the crew caught the same deadly disease.

From the record left by the grown-up centuries years ago, the Enterprise surmised the disaster divided from a medical project that originally had aimed at abating the natural aging process, but it somehow had went off the track making only children survive the side effect.

They could easily developed the antidote by their computer on board, had it not been for the children's stealth of their communicators. Miri clearly had her method to help them get their communicators back or probably it was her who stole their communicators. But the captain just ignored the option of asking her for help until the doctor must test the newly developed antidote by himself.

## The Conscience Of The King 6/9. I was astonished at the dramatic amalgamation of the opera and the reality, as well as the implementation of the topic on justice (aka. Kirk) versus vengeance (aka. Daiken), though I felt Kirk's persuasion towards vengeful Daiken needed more convincing improvement.

Kirk was coaxed by an old friend to identify whether the actor of a troupe performing Macbeth would be the criminal at large for decades. As the same survivor of the holocaust committed by that criminal, Kirk did not believe the accusation until he found no data about the actor before debuting was available, and his old friend was murdered soon after the conversation. So did the other survivors except Kirk himself and his crew named Daiken.

Kirk therefore approached the daughter of the actor to get the access to the troupe and hence the reclusive actor. As he courted with the daughter, the fact that Daiken was poisoned actuated him to interrogate the actor bluntly. The actor, of course, didn't acknowledge the accusation directly in front of Kirk, although Kirk promised he only intended to bring the justice rather than vengeance to the culprit.

As the opera on board began, the sick Daiken watched the piped performance and recognized the old nemesis. Kirk had to persuade him to abandon the attempt of murder while the show was going. The actor and the daughter confessed their crimes through the circumlocutory stage lines. Ultimately, the actor admitted his guilt facing the avenger, but since the daughter had already killed many people to conceal the past crime of her father, she didn't accept this consequence and shot the captain desperately, which was thwarted by the actor at the cost of his own life.

# Core: 4/9. Only the balance of terror and the conscience of the king was endowed with some sort of depth.

# Character: 4/9. Just judged from this anthology, it is hard to memorize characters except Kirk, McCoy and Spock among 400 complement in the ship.
Perhaps it would be better if the author could cast the limelight to the experience of others rather than the captain more. Only Almighty God knows how annoying were Kirk's romantic affairs to me.

# World and Others: 3/9.	Lots of world-building here were minimal, mundane, superficial, and worst, not engaging enough for a second read.
