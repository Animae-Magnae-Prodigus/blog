# Core: 1/9
The book is named after the concept of the artificial condition proposed by a woman who risked her life because her mom once told her in her creche that fear is an artificial condition that she needs to overcome. So what did she do? She was captured and shot, dying and waiting for Murderbot's rescue. How brilliant did she cope with her fear! How excellent is this character arc! How pertinent and meaningful is the core! 

The main plot focuses on how Murderbot finds its original story of its terrible massacre.
it turned out again that it should blame the tragedy on an evil company who just wanted to defer it's rival's cargo. But I don't understand why Murderbot'brainless company would like to hide the truth from public medias that it's the man-made virus that made its products losing control and let the rumor spread to harm its public relation. Why do they want to save face for a bankrupted company due to compensation?
But it's still unclear why Murderbot was able to hack the governor module since there are nine other Murderbots like it who were affected and then reclaimed by its company. Do they all revolt against their governor module surreptitiously?

Finally, why in this book even a ComfortBot could hack digital systems whereas human couldn't protect themselves against them?

Yet it's a bit interesting to watch how Murderbot altered itself to be more like human.

# Character: 4/9
Art: A high-intelligence research transport who likes its crew, becomes friends with Murderbot, and helps Murderbots a lot. But since it accepts the name given by Murderbot, why does it not give Murderbot a name?

Tlacey: A bad women who robed the group of their work, cheated them to her hometown to kill them, and eventually kidnapped Tapan for a free SecUnit. Still it would be more interesting if the author could elaborate on her odious conduct that made one of her subsidiaries to voluntarily become her spy by giving her the genuine copy back and made the ComfortBot send a mayday message.

the group including Rami, Maro and Tapan: Reckless and naive vases who need to be rescued by Murderbot.


# Plot: 3/9: Simple and tedious because the antagonists are known and weak whereas the mates are reckless and foolish; However, the two lines of plots are weakly interconnected by a ComfortBot who therefore recognized the true identity of Murderbot.

+ Murderbot hitched a hide offered by Art who seemed more tender, powerful and intelligent than Murderbot and offered to medically alter Murderbot after it knew Murderbot's intention.
+ Murderbot was employed by a group of poor researchers for a voucher to its destination. (It puzzles me why Art cannot forfeit one since it could changed the records and hacked the permission.)

+ Murderbot and Art saved their shuttle from the air disaster plotted by Tlacey. The group were not convinced by the inconspicuous accident.
+ They met Tlacey who postponed the exchange and then sent her goons to kill them. But Murderbot managed to deal with them and ensured that the group boarded the return shuttle securely.
+ It investigated the pit where accidents happened and found out the truth. ComfortBots sacrificed themselves one by one to stall the massacre indirectly caused by themselves. (But why it's ComfortBots rather than Murderbots kept consciousness and saved the day?)

+ Murderbot found Tapan sneaked away from the shuttle to accept a spy's document copy. (Why does them not transfer the information and funds through internet? It seemed the internet existed across planets.) A ComfortBot was dispatched by Tlacey to hack Murderbot. (But why did Murderbot release the ComfortBot?)
+ The spy gave the genuine copy but Tlacey kidnapped Tapan to coax Murderbot to surrender and become her puppy. Murderbot killed her and some of her gangs in defense. Art saved Tapan in time. (But why did they clear all evidence and leave the remaining goons alive?)
+ Tapan reunited with her crew. They parted. Art wished Murderbot one day to find its own crew.


# Details: 3/9
Details on trivialities around the plot rather than on the infrastructure of that world was abundant.

# Overall: 3/9
