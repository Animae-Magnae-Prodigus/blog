# Plot: 2/9. Its end was not good enough because of the answer was too abrupt, but I have to admit that it had an attractive beginning.
The maintenance rocket left Sergeant Paul Wesson who volunteered to receive aliens alone in Stranger Station. 

Aunt Jane, his alpha network, read him Pigeon's report on his first contact with human, which was different from his childhood memory owing to the bowdlerization on the description of the alien. It also rejected to provide him with videos of their appearance.

He once heard an eerie description related to this place:

> blind as a bat and white bristles all over...

The fact that the radio silence was being imposed on all corners weighed him heavily for the upcoming aliens. 

He doubted why people needed human instead of Jane to receive aliens since the reception was painful to human beings.

Jane told him not to go to Sector Two, he disobeyed and felt extreme nervousness, which turned out to be the first sign of the first contact.

Alien's exudate was elixir to human and that's why people built the expensive station to welcome aliens every two decades.

Gower, Chief of the Outer-world Bureau, commanded him to find out whether the supply was stable for the sake of humanity on Earth. Paul wondered aliens' motives of coming here and benefiting humanity.

He therefore forced Jane to send him the video of the alien, and realized that aliens came here to transform the human by love since aliens were unable to kill. 

In the end, the alien died and station exploded. Paul watched aliens' corpse and thought hate won before his death.

# Core: 0/9. An eerie first contact should be delineated with more delicate details and convincing suspenses. In addition, the abrupt answer related with love and hate was too low. How could Knight convince me Paul's conclusion was not a imagination out of great agony here?



# Character: 1/9. Why did the alpha network have emotion? 



# World and Others: 4/9. I like the description of the station, the space and the Earth from the perspective of a man in agony.



# Overall: 2/9. I will block Knight completely, if his next work doesn't   entertain me. His writing was decent, but his world-building and storytelling were a kind of disaster.
