# Plot: 3/9. 
Miranda was so guilty of her behaviour of cheating her conscript, sacrificed boyfriend decades ago that she accepted the technology in her senile age that enabled her to communicate with him in her dream. At first it worked well, then the apparition blamed her for doing nothing to the war and confessed that he had killed a kid, which didn't act in accordance with the ex in her memory. 

In the end, Miranda lost in a lurid reverie of Vietnam War he might face and finally fulfilling the long-cherished desire of dying together with her ex.

# Core: 3/9. With a plot like this, I could not resonate with the passive heroine who died of her irrevocable, tedious and unnecessary regret.

# Character: 2/9. 

# World and Others: 2/9.
