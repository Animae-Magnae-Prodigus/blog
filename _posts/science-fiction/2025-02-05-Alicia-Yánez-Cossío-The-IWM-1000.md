# Plot: 3/9. I would give a higher score if scenes were depicted more vividly.
It demonstrated a dystopian world where human was born illiterate for the existence of IWM, a know-it-all machine. Some people therefore visited the museum where they learned from shabby syllabaries and eventually experiencing  reading books for the first time without IWM's assistance. Some of them furthered even their rebellious action by thronging the place where IWM claimed to have not yet circulated, only to find themselves attacked by hostile barbarians.




# Core: 5/9. I would give a higher score if Cossío could explain the reason why human abandoned their tradition, lost their education, and ultimately became desperate for a illusion.
By the way, I thought Cossío here mildly criticised people who heavily relied on machine by amplifying how they lost their basic literacy because of their extreme reliance on IWM. Furthermore, they still unlearned the crucial skills of collecting information from different sources and thinking critically and independently. This is why they believed IWM readily and, as a result, ended up in a bunch of dangerous barbarians.



# Character: 1/9. Why did some people feel bad enough to desert IWM? What exactly had happened to them? I would give a higher score if their motivation was explored more thoroughly.



# World and Others: 3/9. Didn't IWM require any engineers to maintain its system? How did it work actually and how did it enable professors to disappear and schools to extinguish? I would give a higher score if the world building was more complete.



# Overall: 3/9. Cossío indeed envisioned an impressive society bizarrely distorted by technology, but did this article truly reflect Cossío's full writing level?
