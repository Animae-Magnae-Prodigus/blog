# Plot: 3/9. I would give a higher score if scenes were depicted more vividly.
It demonstrated an extreme world where human was born illiterate for the existence of IWM, a know-it-all machine. Some people therefore went to the museum where they learned from shabby syllabaries and generally comprehended how to reading books for the first time without IWM's help. Some of them furthered their rebellious action by thronging the place where IWM claimed it didn't circulate and which turned out to be full of hostile barbarians.




# Core: 5/9. I would give a higher score if Cossío could explain the reason why human abandoned their tradition, lost their education, and desperate for a illusion.
By the way, I thought Cossío here mildly criticised people who heavily relied on machine by amplifying how they lost their basic literacy because of IWM. Moreover, they still unlearned the crucial abilities of collecting information from different sources and thinking critically and independently. This is why they believed IWM readily and therefore ended up in a bunch of dangerous barbarians.



# Character: 1/9. Why did some people feel bad enough to desert IWM? What had happened to them?



# World and Others: 1/9. Didn't IWM need any engineers to maintain its system? How did it work actually and how did it enable professors to disappear and schools to extinguish?



# Overall: 3/9. Is it Cossío's true level?
