# Plot: 1/9. How awful the story was presented! Did Womack (at 56 years old) know how to tell a story actually? I would give a higher score if Ocampo could render it in a more formal form. This is a work any mature writer would shame to publish.
In 1975, Zfanseld lent her overcoat to Tilda unnoticed of its ability to transform humanity.

Then countries fell apart: People were classified by their waves. The new authority forbade people to travel freely. The narrator had to falsify their document to date with her love. But their affair were found and reported to the authority who separated them eventually. 

So she volunteered to accept a dangerous operation of changing her wavelength to blend into her love's world.

# Core: 0/9. Sorry, I cannot resonate with the lousy love story.



# Character: 1/9. Sorry, I cannot resonate with the typical brainless heroine existed only in a lousy love story.



# World and Others: 0/9. Did Ocampo know what is world building?



# Overall: 1/9. I'm no longer amazed at the ability of Vandermeer to pick out the worst story from the supposedly best writer. Could you imagine my psychological gap between the introduction and the work?
