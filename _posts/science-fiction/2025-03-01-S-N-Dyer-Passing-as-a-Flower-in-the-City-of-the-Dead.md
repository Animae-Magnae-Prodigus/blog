# Plot: 5/9. 

Henri, an excellent painter who unfortunately accepted the total-body irradiation against the leukemia, and Madeline, Henri's clandestine wife, attended a welcome party for them in a hermetically sealed and thoroughly disinfected space cylinder orbiting above the Earth, which was intentionally set for dying patients unable to survive in the normal environment. Madeline greeted with Bob, the only red blood people conspicuously at the party who was accordingly repellent to the other blue-blooded locals here.

Giselle, her relative who suffered from immunodeficiency from birth and therefore adopted by inhabitants here in a young age, introduced the spouse to others. Madeline, in fact, faked lupus and blue blood to accompany her sick husband to inhabit here for his remaining life, a behaviour which was abhorred by the exclusive natives insomuch as all of this kind of companies eventually returned to Earth and left behind their patients.

Madeline consistently persuaded Giselle to read information sent by her natural mother regardless of the blues' tradition of severing all ties with the past on Earth, which Giselle obeyed after hearing the death story of her brother and consequently found Madeline's concealed marriage. Despite Giselle's own fraud of her blue blood for blending in, she was so raged at this message that she forced Henri to confess everything and bullied Madeline with others. Henri claimed to Madeline that the reason why he fell in love with Giselle and then gave stab in the back to his loyal wife who abandoned totally her career to support Henri's artistic pursuit in space was because he was bound to this place till the end of his life.

The disappointing Madeline forsook her desire of suicide and asked whether Bob came along with her, and Bob explicated that he was immunocompromised owing to the splenectomy in a car accident and could not went out of here, though he didn't bleach his blood like Giselle for the sense of belonging and public acceptance.

In the end, Madeline returned to the Earth alone and restarted her career of sculpture, which was forbidden above for the fear of cutting skins of feeble patients there, with a new identity as a widow.

# Core: 6/9. The story, indicated by marvelous metaphor in its title, was a breakup story set in a bizarre, depressing and closed environment by which Madeline finally passed.
It also prompted me to doubt whether most of the unflagging love I perceived from the romantic drama was not literally often the case in the reality where couples just departed as long as they were incompatible or changed. Nevertheless I didn't understand which kind of love was happier, healthier or better because people in the world just valued things differently.
# Character: 4/9. 

# World and Others: 7/9. I highly appreciated Dyer's brilliant demonstration of her knowledge on medicine within this work particularly the elaboration of blood.
But still the details of this place remained fuzzy like the culture and the life of locals especially the reason why they hated red-blooded people so much. Didn't those weak sick who could not even approach the knife need the necessary labor and service of the red-blooded? How did they make a decent living and enjoy the earthlings' products in this limited, secluded and sterile tin with such a nasty exclusivism?

# Overall: 5/9.
