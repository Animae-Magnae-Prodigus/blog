For me, it’s not so much good science fiction as a full-fledged fantastic story because
+ I couldn’t detect any existence of science—except for Mars, which could be easily substituted by any other laid-back villages on Earth.
+ I couldn’t sense any convincing world building, especially engaging details on the mystical Martian civilization. For example, why didn’t Gallinger, who learned both languages for some unknown reason, instruct the hero face to face for efficiency?
+ I couldn’t understand why the hero’s foretold action could eventually save the sterile species— whether by impregnating the female, breaking into the temple and delivering a self-opinionated harangue.


So personally I would like to give a score of 3/9 (slightly bad) because it incorporated elements I strongly dislike—such as the Christian religion, sexy heroines, rapid crush, superficial passion, lack of understanding and support, fake love, and illogical resolutions for the conflicts—though I understand why some males would like it so much that it was even nominated for the Hugo in 1964.
