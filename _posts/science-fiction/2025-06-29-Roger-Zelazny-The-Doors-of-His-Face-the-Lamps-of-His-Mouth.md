# Plot: 2/9. The protagonist was employed by his ex-girlfriend Luharich to serve as the bait for her to hook a leviathan called Ikky. After a failed first attempt, he encouraged Luharich to push the inject and hence they succeeded in capturing the leviathan.



# Core: 2/9. How could Zelazny write a dangerous fishing story on an alien planet with the magic of narcotizing me thrice?



# Character: 2/9. Nobody here was memorable enough.



# World and Others: 1/9. It would not render any difference if the story happened on Earth.
