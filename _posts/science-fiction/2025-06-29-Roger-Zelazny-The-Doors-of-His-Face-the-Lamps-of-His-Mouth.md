# Plot: 2/9. The protagonist was employed by his ex-girlfriend Luharich to serve as the bait in her hurt for an alien leviathan. After the futile first attempt, he encouraged Luharich to push the Inject and eventually they succeeded in capturing the leviathan.



# Core: 2/9. How could Zelazny manage to turn a dangerous fishing thriller on an alien planet into a tedious novelette with the magic of narcotizing me thrice during the reading? 
By the way, Zelazny's short story always seemed to fully demonstrate his disadvantages, such as low comprehension about science, hackneyed alien world, boring relationships and poor plot without any attractive suspense or intelligent solution.



# Character: 2/9. Nobody here was memorable enough.



# World and Others: 1/9. It would not render any difference if the story happened on Earth.
