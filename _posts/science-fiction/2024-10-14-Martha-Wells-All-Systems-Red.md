# Martha Wells - All Systems Red

# Overall: 5/9

# Core: 3/9.
A cyborg who had hacked its governor module fell in love with human through entertainment feeds.

Though it triggers me to think the human right of robots if they have feelings like humans, the author or the team clearly embraced the idea without much serious, fundamental and academic discussion.

# Character: 6/9.
+ Murderbot: A shy introvert who was accustomed to accept orders and set off on its solitary wandering once it was liberated by Mensah.

+ Mensah: A good, responsible and compassionate female leader who might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer confirmed by Murderbot. 
+ Gurathin: An intriguing frienemy always having tiffs with Murderbot out of suspicion. 
+ Others: Sorry, no impressive moments except their kindness and competence. 

# Plot: 9/9. 
1.	Members in the research group protected by Murderbot were nearly killed by an unidentified fauna and found something missing on their given investigation package. They tried to perform a field research on the missing parts but found nothing special. 
2.	Suddenly, they lost contacts with the other survey team and found enemies by making a foray to their habitat. Murderbot saved them in time but its little secrets was revealed during repair but it was accepted by the group generally due to its heroic behaviors made to the team before. It also pointed out they are abetted by their enemy to doubt its loyalty. Had it not been for its special autonomy, their enemy would hack it long time ago to kill them all. They followed its suggestions,   deserted their habitat and sent their becon.  A small detachment including Murderbot and Mensah came back to identify their enemy but their blood-curdling enemy also figured them out in turn and called for an arrangement by destroying their beacon. 
3.	Murderbot and Mensah had to swindle their enemy to launch the other beacon for rescue. Murderbot protected Mensah from the disastrous consequences of the launch of the beacon. 
4.	Mensah permanently bought Murderbot when they came back and told to Murderbot that it’s a free agent since now though she had to be its guardian. Murderbot was clearly puzzled by the sudden liberty and didn't know what it wanted without human’s commands and required contracts. So it secretly left its favorite person who offered to accommodate it and set off on a self-exploring trip.

# Details: 3/9.
What kind of details did you expect from a novella? It encompassed enough details around the plot without any elaboration on that galactic world.
