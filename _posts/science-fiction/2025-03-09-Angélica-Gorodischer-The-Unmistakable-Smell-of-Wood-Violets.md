# Plot: 2/9. All the people in this world are amazed at the news that a female astronaut in Rosario managed to fly to the space and witnessed the nothingness of everything beyond the limits of the universe for the first time in human history.

# Core: 2/9. Gorodischer was good at depicting trifle, unnecessary, cumbersome scenes, but poor at blending her world-building into exciting plots, imaging record realistic space travels, and catching readers' attention.

# Character: 2/9. 

# World and Others: 1/9.
