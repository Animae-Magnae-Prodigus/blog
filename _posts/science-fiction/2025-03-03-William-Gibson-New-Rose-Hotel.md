# Plot: 3/9. 
while the hero was evading from the hunting of revengeful Hosaka in New Rose Hotel , he couldn't help  recalling Randii, his girlfriend who helped the hero and Fox abduct Hiroshi—one of the best genetic scientists worked for Maas (Hosaka's primary competitor)—to serve for Hosaka. however, Randii turned out as a spy destroying precious brains of Hosaka and incapacitating the biological research team of the company with a diskette , possibly because her father had once been disgraced and disowned by Hosaka or just  bought over by Maas in the meanwhile.

the hero remembered  finding a suspicious diskette inside her purse not long ago, though he kept it secret, since he wasn't willing to believe his lover had harboured some ulterior motives.





# Core: 3/9. One of the worst pitfalls of the first-person perspective is that  some lazy authors often fail to render clear narratives, logical protagonists, lively supporting   figures, wonderful world-building and essential plots to stimulate enough fluctuations of emotions or wonders within the minds of readers by forcing readers to endure  only on the limited protagonist's tedious harangue and some unnecessary, superfluous details, which was perfectly exemplified by this work.

# Character: 3/9. Randii, the heroine who played an important role in this article acted as a fabulous vase or an "ectoplasm" incapable of speaking any direct concrete words. What a brilliant character!

# World and Others: 3/9. 

# Overall: 3/9.
