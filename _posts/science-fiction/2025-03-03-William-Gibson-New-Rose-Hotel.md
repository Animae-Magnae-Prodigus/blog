# Plot: 3/9. 
the hero was evading from the hunting of revengeful Hosaka in New Rose Hotel and recalling Randii, his girlfriend who helped the hero and Fox abduct Hiroshi—one of the best genetic scientists worked for Maas, Hosaka's primary competitor—to serve for Hosaka, but turned out as a spy destroying precious brains of Hosaka and incapacitating the biological research team of the company, possibly because her father was once disgraced and disowned by Hosaka or bought by Maas in the meanwhile.

the hero reminded himself of finding a suspicious diskette inside her purse not long ago, though he kept it as a secret since he wasn't willing to believe his lover had harboured some ulterior motives in approaching him at first.





# Core: 3/9. One of the worst reasons to avoid the first-person perspective was because some lazy authors often failed to render clear narratives, logic protagonist, lively side figures, wonderful world buildings and essential plots to stimulate enough fluctuations of emotions or wonders within the minds of readers by forcing readers to concentrate only on the limited protagonist's tedious harangue and unnecessary details, which was perfectly demonstrated by this work.

# Character: 3/9. Randii, the heroine who played an important role in this article acted as a fabulous vase or "ectoplasm" incapable of speaking any direct concrete words. What a brilliant character!

# World and Others: 3/9. 

# Overall: 3/9.
