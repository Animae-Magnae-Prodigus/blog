# Core: 4/9. If women can maintain their own nation, what would it be like? Or how does a nation look if they are dominated mostly by women? I like this core, but I don't think Hossain explained it well. In fact, this work demonstrated her ignorance of men, women, humanity, science, and society.


# Character: 2/9. What do you expect from a conte philosophe?


# Plot: 2/9. An absurd dream. I don't like women disparaging men when they indeed made some contribution to society, like fighting for the country till death and developing the technology of solar heat. How was it different from men who ignore women's capability all the time?
Sultana lounged in an easy chair in her bedroom, and Sister Sara invited her to come out and have a look at her garden. 

To her surprise, it was a fine morning outside. Some women said Sultana was as shy and timid as men. Then she found she mistook a stranger for Sister Sara. 

As Sultana expressed her embarrassment in walking about unveiled, Sara told her this was Ladyland, where men were locked in their zenanas because they were dangerous in nature. 

Sultana reached Sara's house. Sara thought men wasted most of their working time smoking, and people here worked little yet efficiently. Sultana demonstrated how they used solar heat to cook in the kitchen.

Thirty years ago, the queen here ordained that all the women should be educated, so girls' schools were founded. They had a girls' university that developed the technology of drawing water from the atmosphere and stopping bad weather. Then the men in the other university collected and stored as much sun-heat as they wanted.

People came from a neighbouring country invaded their country, and most men sacrificed themselves in the war for Queen's imprudent decision of keeping refugees. At the crucial point deciding the fate of their nation, Lady Principal demanded all the men should enter the zenanas for the sake of purdah and then directed all the rays of the concentrated sunlight to defeat the enemy. They then never allowed men to get out of their zenanas, and gradually men were accustomed to the purdah system. (How absurd they were!)
Their religion was based on love and truth. So if one person lied against their rule of being truthful, they were punished with ostracism forever. (How cruel they were!)

Sara then took her to see the queen, who told her:

> We do not covet other people's land, we do not fight for a piece of diamond, nor do we grudge a ruler his Peacock Throne. We dive deep into the ocean of knowledge and try to find out the precious gems that nature has kept in store for us. We enjoy nature's gifts as much as we can.


# World and Others: 4/9. 
The city looked like a nice garden because they forbade rail, cars, and freight, and only aerial conveyances were allowed. They also absorbed water from clouds, making the whole city fine all the time. Their chief food is fruits. Most of the equipment is driven by clear energy like sun-heat and electricity.


# Overall: 3/9. Works like this seemed to smear the feminism. It would be more appropriate to write out the real struggle and obstacles women faced.
