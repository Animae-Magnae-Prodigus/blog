# Plot: 7/9. It's a fiery confrontation between two species who contacted each other for the first time. As usual, people who were less powerful yet more intelligent found out the blind side of the enemy and thus won the day. The method used here was simple but classical yet I indeed failed to guess it out.
People mistook mangors as innocuous shrubbery and consequently crushed its branches into its middle for specimen. In retaliation, mangors hence lifted their all-terrain vehicle up, squeezed and reverse it as common strategies against their primordial enemy. But all-terrain vehicle was so strong that those methods didn't work at all.

Human's first attempt to save their stranded colleagues by using their lethal plaza rifle to clear a way was thwarted by mangors' intentional ambush. When mangors sensed merely the squeeze was unable to annihilate their prisoners, it released erosive juice which dissolved the upper layer of their space suits. To agitate the case, the last free man was caught while rushing out towards crying hostages.

At the critical moment, the biologist in the all-terrain vehicle observed that giant water lice eating leaves inside mangors were still undisturbed by their warfare and mangors was so fatigued to lift their new captive up now.

Therefore he ventured to go outside the vehicle and crawl through mangors, which proved that mangors could not detect what kinds of tiny creature was inside them just as in normal conditions, human weren't able to be conscious of the existence of their microbes within their own bodies.

Soon all the passengers came out and liberated their hapless mates, which was strongly reminiscent of a live version of the sculpture of Laocoon.

Eventually, the hurricane foreshadowed at the beginning of the article bonged the knell of mangors bent on holding their all-terrain vehicle.

# Core: 7/9. I’m particularly interested in science fiction with elements of puzzles, mysteries and adventure. This is why this story indeed turned me on with its detailed observations, dramatic conflicts and reasonable but unexpected solutions, although this concise ending was not vivid enough for me.



# Character: 6/9. I would give a higher score if other characters were described with more detail. Although the biologist here was admirable with his intrepid experiment and psychological depiction:
> In particular, one had to realize that mankind’s omnipotence was not in his strength or in the powerful forms of energy he had mastered, or in the complexity of its machines….It was not even in its wisdom: It was to be found in the flexibility, breadth, and farsightedness of his thought. Another prejudice: One had to be aware that a tactic that had worked a thousand times would not definitely work the thousand and first. And another: One had to clear one’s mind of the idea that human beings are always rational, when in fact they are only rational **when they can seize and assess something new and rebuild their former image of the world, and act in accordance with reality, whatever that might now be.**



# World and Others: 7/9. Mangors were vividly depicted including its nature and idiosyncrasies.



# Overall: 7/9. Bilenkin was my cup of tea and I'm looking forward to read more works from Dmitri Bilenkin and *Aliens, Travelers, and Other Strangers*.
