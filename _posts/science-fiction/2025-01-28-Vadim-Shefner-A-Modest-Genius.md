# Plot: 2/9. A tawdry love story.
Sergei one day helped two girls called Liussia and Svetlana. 

At first, he had a crash on Liussia, but Sergei soon believed that he could not live without Svetlana who expected someone unusual. Svetlana wanted to walk on the water so Sergei designed water skate for them to slid easily on the surface of the sea. However, Svetlana rejected Sergei because she expected a more extraordinary boyfriend.

Sergei invented a camera that could reflect scenes in the future at the same place. He took a photo on Liussia, but the graph had a figure he didn't recognize rather than Liussia, which disappointed Liussia and left him immediately.

He soon met the woman called Tamara and married her, which turned out to be a nightmare. In order to avoid Tamara's constant scold, Sergei built antigravitation and work on the ceiling of the house, but still it didn't satisfy Tamara who just wanted an ordinary husband.

After wars, Sergei constantly invented things but most of them were useless. His wife and son disliked him and vice versa. Tamara frankly spoke out that she had a affair with a cemetery director. One day he tapped that Liussia still wanted him and thought his water skate for Svetlana was marvelous.

Then he reinvented the skate, took out the spray of strengthening the surface tension of the sea, and used a machine to restore to their youth. After skating, they finally confessed their belated love on the sea.


# Core: 4/9. If you don't try your best to find your true love in youth, you will definitely regret in your senility because you don't have the machine to set back your time.



# Character: 1/9. It's unreasonable for a person to invent so many garnets without considering contributing to the world at all. How selfish he was! Also the females here again were just vases. Liussia was so strange to leave for a simple photo.



# World and Others: 1/9. How could Sergei invent so many marvelous apparatuses but didn't sell one of them out? Where did his fund come from? Personal salary?



# Overall: 2/9. I disliked those writers who created magical gadgets with scientific  nomenclatures to call their work science fiction without concerning the principle, the context or the implication of those gadgets to the world. No wonder some serious writers didn't enjoy being classified as writers of science fiction and used this area as only springboards.
