# Plot: 1/9. A meaningless joke.
Ceran Swicegood, one of Special Aspects Man, always wondered the origin of the universe. 

They reached an asteroid called Proavitus where Ceran learned that Provitoi didn't die and when they were old, they just stayed at home sleeping all the time and became smaller and smaller.

Ceran thus intended to find the very first generation and asked how their species began. But the oldest grandmother told him a funny joke began their species.


# Core: 0/9. What do you expect for a joke? What is the joke?



# Character: 1/9. I didn't understand why Ceran finally changed his name after hearing the joke.



# World and Others: 1/9. At least it depicts a strange species.



# Overall: 1/9. I would like to give Lafferty another try before completely blocking Lafferty. Did this article represent one of Vandermeer's faults or Lafferty's true level?
