# Plot: 4/9. This bizarre, unsettled, grotesque, and concise story told  people couldn't escape the aftermath of torture and even became the torturer against their own will.
People once imprisoned by the aliens returned one by one to the Earth, whose deformed bodies caused by the aliens unsettled the mass.

Survivors told the authority that they were mentally controlled by the snap of aliens.

Binns, one of survivors, went to the park on the rainy day. He found a secret young man called Teris stalking him and it turned out he was sent to protect him clandestinely. Binns tended to chatted with him but failed. When he walked on the grass and saw the other six, he killed Teris suddenly and made two snaps nearly paralyzing everyone. 

> they gave birth to their master.



# Core: 3/9. Survivors could not ensure the effect of the experiment was eradicated at all after their return including others' opinions. I would give a higher score if the concrete medical analysis of their deformed body or more information on the aliens was given.



# Character: 1/9. No one was impressive enough. Binns was too abrupt.



# World and Others: 1/9. What is the purpose of the alien? What is the meaning of the last two snap? What will this new master do on the Earth?



# Overall: 2/9.
