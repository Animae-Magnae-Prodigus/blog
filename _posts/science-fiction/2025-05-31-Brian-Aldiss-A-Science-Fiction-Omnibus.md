# Plot: 0/9.

## Introduction
> Alice Sheldon," those eight years in SF bd.1T

## Sole Solution 3/9. This article was so predictable for me that I anticipated the ending immediately in the beginning because I once read Asimov's the last question.
And clearly I am not a fan of this kind of laughable anthropomorphic origin of the universe, since this article, compared to Asimov's, showed nothing peculiar about the science or the speculation other than a hackneyed opening extracted from a classic only lasting several millennia, infinitesimal compared to the enormous age of the real universe.
