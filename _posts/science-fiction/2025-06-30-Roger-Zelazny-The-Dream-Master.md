# Plot: ?/9. The tempo was dull and slow. Scenes were incoherent and abrupt, interspersed with abstruse stream of consciousness.
1. The protagonist, a psychotherapist who could control their patients' dreams, diagnosed that his patient's unreasonable concern of his assassination derided from the fact that, as a politician, he subconsciously wanted others' extreme emotions towards him. After that, he agreed to help Eileen, a congenital blind novice, to accommodate her mind into visual impression and thus become a qualified therapist.
2. Along with her dog that could speak, Eileen accepted the protagonist's first therapy.
3. The protagonist talked about the danger of his method upon the therapists while sending his son to the hospital. Eileen performed an emergency tracheotomy in the theatre.

(I have found that I read the wrong version, which accounted for the loose structureâ€”lots of author tended to prolong their original famous work so as to make more money. But seldom did they surpass the shorter ones.)


# Core: ?/9. Changing others' mind by entering their dreams at the cost of operators' own lives was not a rare theme.



# Character: ?/9. 


# World and Others: ?/9. The world-building was magnificent but somewhat uninteresting.
