# Plot: 8/9. It's a classical natural adventure story set on an alien planet with a mystery surrounding the secret of Grandpa throughout culminating in hero's pivotal revelation and salvation.
Cord, a junior colonial student working for Colonial Team in Sutang, anesthetized an unfamiliar swamp bug and its strange bug rider for his independent and unsolicited research, while waiting for the Planetary Regent to inspect the Yoger Bay Station.
However, Grayan Mahoney, his close friend and colleague, interrupted his action to warn him of his imminent trouble: Owing to his repeated disciplinary violations, Nirmond, the station manager, wanted to send him back. Cord hence determined to behave himself during the tour by acting as a qualified guide.

The team consisted of Grayan, Regent, Nirmond and Cord. Nirmond planned to use Grandpa as their raft, so Cord led them to its location. But Cord felt it strange that Grandpa had moved far away from the spot he left.
When he found Grandpa was sprouting, he attempted to dissuade them from using it for it had an unknown factor now. But unlike him, the others were all sticklers for the Regulation which had prescribed the rafts as harmless. Reluctantly, he piloted this raft for fear of dismissal.

One yellowhead came down from its reed and disappeared under their raft. Five minutes later, he found the raft uncontrollable. And it even jumped abruptly to ensnare passengers with vegetable-like ropes at the foot of its cone. Luckily Cord managed to stay out of reach.

Regent directed him to anesthetize the other two instead of using explosive bullets directly and informed him of the others' condition. Cord then anesthetized Regent as well against her own willingness, because he knew the raft was heading towards the sea and the chance of survival was scarce. He though felt obliged to try his best to rescue them before the raft entered the sea which would make him abandon them for the sake of his own life.

He attempt of the anesthetic pellets on the raft didn't work. Worse, it blossomed and broadened slits oozing saliva. Worst, Grayan regained her consciousness and began to struggle. So Cord eventually gave them a strong dose of anesthetic to relieve everyone else of the unnecessary pain.

He rammed his knife into Grandpa as it entered the rushing current to the strait, but it still held its preys tightly. 

When Cord was about to jump off the raft, a seal flinging itself out of the water indicated his escape would be doomed, since there were thousands of hunters on his way to the shore.

He realized his finality in desperation. 

But after watching Grandpa eat sentient riders attentively, he got the epiphany that it was the intelligent yellowhead that transformed the mild, herbivorous Grandpa into alert, capable carnivore, as a part of the distinct propagation system of this planet.

So he got rid of the yellowhead under Grandpa and regained the control eventually.

# Core: 8/9. It emphasizes the importance of not sticking to written rules too blindly to beware of minor aberrations especially in the exotic environment. Also, it gave a unique extraterrestrial biological style to emphasize the significance of the independent research.
Even the most familiar entity with unexpected changes needs to be investigated thoroughly till the aberration could be explained.



# Character: 7/9. It's impressive to see good female characters for a sci-fi written in 1955. I would give a higher score if woman here played a more important role.
Cord was a quintessential rogue hero dealing with the mission of life and death alone and eventually proving his bravery by breaking through the seemingly impossible challenge. Although I cannot agree with his sedation that silenced all the potential suggestions or last words.

Grayan was a good friend who tried her best to help Cord to stay here.

Regent, a female leader here, remained her composure and even directed Cord to deal with it preliminarily and left Cord himself to decide what for the best.

Even Nirmond who wanted to sack Cord showed his intelligence somehow.



# World and Others: 8/9. The alien environment was fabulous, with the captivating details of its fauna and flora. From ugly yellowhead to brutal snappers, the world felt rich and impressive. A lively yet dangerous world was the best place for an adventurous spirit.

# Overall: 8/9. I look forward to reading  more of Schmitz's works especially his books with heroines because I'm fascinated with adventurous characters navigating intricate nature.
