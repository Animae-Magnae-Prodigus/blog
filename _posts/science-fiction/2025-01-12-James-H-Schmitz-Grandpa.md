# Plot: 8/9. It's a classical natural adventure story set in an alien planet. But it's also a mystery story on the secret of the raft as it was hinted everywhere before the hero's final act.
Cord, a junior colonial student working for Colonial Team in Sutang, anesthetized an unfamiliar swamp bug and its strange bug rider for his independent and unsolicited research while waiting for the Planetary Regent to inspect the Yoger Bay Station.
However, Grayan Mahoney, his good friend and star colleague, disrupted his action to warn him of his imminent trouble: Owing to his multiple attempts of violating disciplines, Nirmond, the station manager, wanted to send him back. Cord hence determined to behave himself during the tour and acted as a qualified guide.

The team includes Grayan, Regent, Nirmond and Cord. Nirmond planned to use Grandpa as their raft, so Cord led them to its location. But Cord felt it strange that Grandpa moved far away from the spot he left two weeks ago.
Then as he found Grandpa was spouting, he attempted to dissuade them from using it for it had an unknown factor now. But unlike him, they were all sticklers for the Regulation which had prescribed the raft as harmless. So he had to go along with them and drive this raft for fear of sending back.

One yellowhead came down from its reed and disappeared under their raft. Five minutes later, he found the raft lost control. Suddenly, the raft jumped to catch the other passengers in green vegetable ropes at the foot of its cone. Luckily it's not long enough to capture him.

Regent directed him to anesthetize charges instead of explosive bullets and informed him of others' condition. Cord then shot her too against her own willingness, because he knew the raft was heading towards the sea and the possibility of survival was scarce. He though felt obliged to try his best to rescue them before he had to abandon them for his own life.

He tried the anesthetic pellets on the raft and it didn't work. Worse, it blossomed and broadened its slits where the saliva spilled out. Worst, Grayan woke up and struggled. So Cord eventually gave all of human thorough anesthetics to relieve them of the unnecessary pain.

He rammed his knife into Grandpa as it entered the rushing current to the strait, but it still held its preys tightly. 

When Cord was about to jump off the raft, a seal flinging itself out of the water indicated his doomed scheme of escape since there were thousands of hunters on his way to the shore.

He realized his finality. 

But after watching Grandpa eat sentient riders attentively, he got the epiphany that it was the intelligent yellowhead that made the mild and herbivore Grandpa suddenly changed into the form of alert and capable carnivore, as was the distinct propagation system on this planet.

So he got rid of the yellowhead under Grandpa and regained the control of Grandpa.

# Core: 7/9. It emphasizes the principle of not sticking to written rules too blindly to beware of minor aberrations especially in the exotic environment.
Even the familiar thing with unexpected changes needs to be investigated thoroughly till the aberration could be explained.



# Character: 7/9. It's impressive to have good female characters in sci-fi in 1955.
Cord was a typical rogue hero dealing with the mission of life and death alone and eventually proved his bravery. Although I cannot agree his shot that silenced all the possible suggestions or the last words.

Grayan was a good friend who tried her best to help Cord to stay here.

Regent was a female leader here! And she was not panic and even directed Cord calmly how to deal with it preliminarily.

Even Nirmond who wanted to sack Cord showed his intelligence somehow.



# World and Others: 7/9. The environment was fabulous, and the fauna and flora were also impressive.



# Overall: 7/9. I would like to read more on Schmitz especially his books with heroines because I'm fascinated with adventurous characters interacting with intricate nature.
