# Plot: 3/9. 
Allie, a pathosfinder, was dispatched to cure unfortunate Gladney whose both musical talents and original characteristics were lost in an attack from a frenzy fan who admired Gladney's talents so much that he intended to rob Gladney's memory to become another Gladney, only to incur self-destruction owing to being two people at once. 

Allie came into Gladney's mind and found the reason why Gladney failed in recognizing his own past work, obtained the absolute perfect pitch after the accident, encountered a bottleneck in convalescent creation sensed by his chief doctor, composed some incomplete music only through the revelation of his dreams about himself was because he subconsciously misperceived a doppelganger made of his own guilt and imagination as his real ego and thereby didn't accept himself entirely. 

In the end Allie helped him overcome the terror, incorporated the doppelganger and reconstruct the self-confidence, though he still sulked over the existence of the old self.

# Core: 3/9. I disliked this work, for it's absolutely a literal, abhorrent, and sacrilegious catastrophe to watch how Cadigan converted the auditory information abundant in emotions into the flaccid literary form deficient in any entertainment, and therewith built a tedious plot with an uninteresting first-person perspective based on an illogical, fantastic world building brimful with unnecessary, dull details.

# Character: 3/9. 

# World and Others: 4/9. 

# Overall: 3/9.
