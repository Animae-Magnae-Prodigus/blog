# Plot: 6/9. The plot was so simple that I somewhat anticipated the appearance of the Mechanist to spice things up during my reading of the work which could be recapitulated in three sentences:
In order to create a powerful military army with endless manpower resources against the other fraction of human called the Mechanist, the hero of the Shaper carried out an on-the-spot experiment on species of the swarm with the artificial pheromones, only to find that the swarm detected this abnormality and subsequently gave birth to a high-intelligent being, aka the mind, to deal with the imminent challenge. The mind told the hero that human wasn't the first to attempt to exploit the swarm and all the previous malevolent species now only remained in the swarm in the form of low intelligence, insomuch as their own species outside had become completely extinct by the consequences of their high intelligence. 

Eventually, for fear of the involuntary reproduction after his death and with the (over)confidence of the ability of humanity, he capitulated to the swarm on the condition that he could maintain his full consciousness so as to teach human's knowledge to his progeny in this swarm.

# Core: 6/9. Despite not fully convinced that intelligence would be the critical impediment to the immortality of the species, I'm exactly impressed with the great biologic diversity of this swarm.



# Character: 4/9. The hero here was an unqualified spy who told all his plans and dreams out upon being asked, which would be more plausible after he got acquaintance with the heroine. The heroine here was a guide and researcher whose personal settings would be more interesting, had it not been for the intentional abbreviation of their experiment and experience within the swarm.



# World and Others: 7/9. Again, the world building of a prosperous swarm requires a more detailed plot with emotions to emphasize the sense of wonder.



# Overall: 6/9. It's said to be Sterling's first published work which indeed manifested the indispensable capability of a fabulous world building for a science-fiction writer and his great improving potential in the aspect of plots.
