# Plot: 8/9. I like the mystery and the sentiment within this story. However, I would give a higher score if the environment could be depicted more in detail. None the less, it had a complete drama structure: When mystery was dissolved, the conflict came to its zenith and the story ended with impressive tragedy.
LaFarge found a little boy like Tom, his long dead son, standing in his yard on a rainy night. He left the door unhatched and acquiesced the boy to come into his house. It came in finally and acted as his son. When LaFarge asked him whether it was a Martian, it went off on one and ran out of the door.

Tom returned in the afternoon saying he was once trapped by a small tin house and nearly couldn't come back ever again to see them. But Tom was unwilling to give more information on it. Later, LaFarge heard that one murderer in the tin house saw his victim came back from Earth and ended his own life out of fear and guilt.

At night, Anna, LaFarge's wife, commanded everyone to go to town despite Tom's rejection. Tom was afraid of the people and murmured something more about changing and trap in his nap on boat. Tom asked LaFarge to stick with him but unfortunately they were careened apart by the drunken. Tom then was gone. At first they kept calm and thought Tom would reappear at the boat. But it didn't work. It was up to LaFarge to find their lost child. 

Mike told him the Spauldings found their long lost daughter Lavinia on the street. So he sneaked into the Spauldings' yard and confirmed the Martian was there. The Martian told him the truth that it was easily caught by people's ideals in their minds. It was forced to meet human's needs and could not determine its own fate. Though at first it rejected LaFarge's recall, yet it finally obeyed LaFarge's will and slid down through the vines.

In order to escape the Spauldings, LaFarge volunteered to lead them off for Tom to go ahead to the boat. But the boy wasn't there when he came back. Then he found lots of people was chasing after a running figure in the plaza. They all surrounded Tom and claimed that figure was someone that they recognized and wanted Tom to come with them including LaFarge. The poor Martian changed its shape for whoever touched him and finally exploded.

It began to rain. At bed, LaFarge heard something again, but this time his expectation didn't come true when he checked the door.

# Core: 4/9. Most people has a person who they wanted to see and sometimes they don't mind it's just an illusion to get some mental appeasement.



# Character: 6/9. The Martian could not determine its fate because of his physiological default of fulfilling everyone's demands. He couldn't know who he was and his identity was construed out of others' thoughts and expectation. He even couldn't choose the people who it wanted to stay with. It wanted to head for LaFarge at last rather than the Spauldings, which somehow showed its free will albeit at the cost of its own life.


# World and Others: 1/9. The wording was so concise and the world was so mundane. The story could be placed at any closed places on earth and the Martian could be substituted for fairies and monsters in the lore.

# Overall: 5/9. Bradbury was a good writer but was not a typical sci-fi writer, which was clearly showed in this short story.
