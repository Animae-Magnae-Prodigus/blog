# Plot: 7/9. 
## Chapter 1: Sol 6
The narrator left stranded on Mars alone by teammates who had thought him dead and had returned to the Earth in no time.

## Chapter 2: Sol 7-Sol 22
the list of inventory:
+ Food:
	+ 400-Day rations with enough nutrients 
	+ The narrator occupied himself in growing potatoes that may extend his life 90 days or so.
+ Water: 
	+ A running reclaimer without backup
	+ Most of 300 liters of stored water was planned to cultivate the potato.
+ Gas: An oxygenator with a short-term spare
+ Energy: 200M^2^ solar cells 
+ Communication: The broken radio array was unredeemable.
+ Transportation: Two rovers and five suits with 1500 hours' worth of CO~2~ filters 
+ Salvation: The possible landing of Ares 4 four years later 

## Chapter 3: Sol 25-Sol 30
+ Food: He extended the arable farmland by using rovers' pop-tents and other vacancies in the Hab so that he might survive despite the long-term starvation.
+ Water: He was about to hook the fuel plant of MAV up to Hab's oxygenator for the oxygen, and run the hydrazine, the fuel of MDV, over a catalyst for the hydrogen.

## Chapter 4: Sol 32-Sol 37
+ Water: He used a wooden cross to ignite oxygen, a spacesuit to store water and several plastic bags to build up a chimney of controlling hydrogen. However, during the experiment, he was unnoticed of the existence of the other oxygen tank, and therefore the tricky overflow of hydrogen in the atmosphere of Hab.

## Chapter 5: Sol 38-Sol 41
+ Water: He hibernated his bacteria by lowering the room temperature and bamboozled the atmospheric regulator into extracting all the oxygen in the room so as to burn off the remaining hydrogen bit by bit. Despite the minor explosion caused by the oxygen he exhaled, he managed to get rid of the overflowed hydrogen.

## Chapter 6: Sol 42-Sol 61
Venkat, the director of this project, persuaded NASA's administrator, Teddy, to investigate the condition of the protagonist's cadaver immediately for the sake of more grants from Congress. However, NASA found the protagonist still alive and therefore informed the public of this news.

Although they promised to try their best to save the protagonist in public, yet NASA could not communicate with the protagonist owing to the broken communication array, Teddy didn't agree to risk the other astronauts' life for the protagonist and he even commanded to conceal this thing from the returning astronauts.

# Core: 8/9. The protagonist was a talented problem-solver facing a series of extreme circumstances about life and death with an optimistic philosophy of "work the problem".
## Water
Why didn't the protagonist calculate the heat scientifically, evaluate the potential high risk and make up corresponding remedies before making such a dangerous fire experiment in the one and only Hab?

The fact that he's not a chemist was absolutely not a rightful excuse to avoid learning the necessary chemistry in advance instead of just performing a dangerous experiment himself brusquely, considering how adequate the time and resources he enjoyed!

In reality, he would definitely have died of this procedure, which made me feel more unrealistic than the unlikely Martian sandstorm, let alone the exhaling oxygen that fortunately exploded when the hydrogen was nearly exhausted.

# Fire
Why did NASA, who had not equipped them with lighters, provide them with materials of handmade bombs?

+ Food: 
+ Gas:

+ Salvation: 

# Character: 6/9. 

# World and Others: 8/9.
