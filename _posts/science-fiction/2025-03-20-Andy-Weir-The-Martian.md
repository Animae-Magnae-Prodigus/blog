# Plot: 8/9. The frequent pattern of the narrative of this book was basically like that: The protagonist faced the problem and found a plan, which he then executed in extremely unnecessary, redundant, and tedious details. Sometimes it went wrong and incurred a new problem, so as to repeat this pattern...

## Chapter 1: Sol 6. Begin
The narrator was stranded on Mars alone since his teammates thought him dead and therefore returned to the Earth in no time.

## Chapter 2: Sol 7-Sol 22. List out the inventory:
+ Food:
	+ 400-Day rations with enough nutrients
	+ The narrator occupied himself in growing potatoes that may extend his life 90 days or so.
+ Water:
	+ A running reclaimer without backup
	+ Most of 300 liters of stored water was planned to cultivate the potato.
+ Gas: An oxygenator with a short-term spare
+ Energy: 200M^2^ solar cells
+ Communication: The broken radio array was unredeemable.
+ Transportation: Two rovers and five suits with 1500 hours' worth of CO~2~ filters
+ Salvation: The possible landing of Ares 4 four years later

## Chapter 3: Sol 25-Sol 30. Food
He extended the arable farmland by using rovers' pop-tents and other vacancies in the Hab so that he might survive despite the long-term starvation.

## Chapter 4: Sol 32-Sol 37. Water
He hooked the fuel plant of MAV up to Hab's oxygenator for the oxygen, and ran the hydrazine, the fuel of MDV, over a catalyst for the hydrogen. He used a wooden cross to ignite oxygen, a spacesuit to store water and several plastic bags to build up a chimney of controlling hydrogen.

However, during the experiment, he was unnoticed of the existence of the other oxygen tank, and therefore the tricky overflow of hydrogen in the atmosphere of Hab.

## Chapter 5: Sol 38-Sol 41. Water
He hibernated his bacteria by lowering the room temperature and bamboozled the atmospheric regulator into extracting all the oxygen in the room so as to burn off the remaining hydrogen bit by bit. Despite the minor explosion caused by the oxygen he exhaled, he managed to get rid of the overflowed hydrogen.

## Chapter 6: Sol ?. NASA found him alive.
Venkat, the director of this project, persuaded NASA's administrator, Teddy, to investigate the condition of the protagonist's cadaver for the sake of more grants from Congress after Teddy's two-month procrastination for fear of the subsequent PR issue. However, NASA found the protagonist still alive and therefore informed the public of this news.

Although they promised to try their best to save the protagonist in public, yet NASA could not communicate with the protagonist owing to the broken communication array, Teddy didn't agree to risk the other astronauts' life for the protagonist and he even commanded to conceal this thing from the returning astronauts.

## Chapter 7: Sol 63-Sol 68. Energy and transportation
In order to reach Ares 4, 3200km away from the camp, on his own, he transformed one of the rovers by equipping it with the battery of the other and solar plates for energy. After a failed experiment, he decided to have recourse to the dangerous RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator) for cheap heat.

## Chapter 8: Sol?
Kapoor, the director of Mars operation for NASA, was interviewed by CNN and announced that they were monitoring Mark closely and would try their best to bring him home. They finally figured out the propose of Mark's latest sojourn was to find the dilapidated Pathfinder and build connection with the Earth.

(The suspense of this chapter and reactions from the Earth were so great that it is a pity to find the next chapter again abounded with the harangue of our protagonist.)

## Chapter 9: Sol 79-Sol 83. Communication
The protagonist found the Pathfinder after a seven-day exploration and managed to load it up to the car with a handmade slope.

## Chapter 10: Sol 90-Sol 96. Communication
The protagonist brought the Pathfinder back safe and sound before he repaired it to wait for any positive feedback from the side of the Earth.

## Chapter 11: Sol 97-Sol 98. Communication
The protagonist first communicated with the Earth by sending the picture of his written words and reading the spelt ASCII indicated by the rotating remote camera controlled by the Earth.

He then broke his back to transcribe the code of the rover required for building the connection with the Pathfinder. And finally, using the updated pathfinder as the router, he could initiate a more convenient conversation with the Earth.

## Chapter 12: Sol 6-Sol 96. A recount from the third person perspective centering on the other team members before final good news
On their way to the MAV, flying wreckage hit our protagonist, Watney, and carried him away. The commander, Lewis, risked her life to find him alone in the nearly invisible sandstorm responsibly. However, other teammates believed the presumable death of Watney and prompted Louis to catch the final precious opportunity of boarding while the orbital maneuvering system alleviated the severe tipping condition of shuttle, which Louis obeyed eventually.

Four months later, when they heard the breaking news of Watney's survival, Louis reprimanded herself into abandoning Watney behind.

(Maybe things would be better if they had spent some days in checking the corpse of Watney through the satellite in the orbit before heading for home immediately, so that as long as Watney woke up, he could directly ascend to the space by launching the other MAV already deployed on Mars. Of course, the chance that Watney survived in this condition is as infinitesimal as the heavy sandstorm of this kind on Mars, so it is excusable for them to desert him and the planet in no time.)

## Chapter 13: Sol 144-Sol 119. Communication, Supply And The Breach Of The Airlock {#c13}
NASA was afraid of the sole means of communication and therefore asked the protagonist to learn the Morse code just in case. However, they felt astonishingly okay with the protagonist's sole solution of dealing with the crucial problem on famine by postponing the original plan of sending supplies before Sol 400 to the Sol 856. (I don't understand any logic here if it existed.)

The canvas of the airlock tore unexpectedly and the Hab's atmosphere breached and throw it forty metres away including an unaware protagonist within it.

# Core: 6/9. In a word, it is a good  Robinson science fiction that, however, personally I do not want to read twice because of the large extent of the protagonist's monologue. 
The building of character, the interspersed humor, and the narrative skill especially concerned with the suspense had a great room for improvement so as to flavor the tedious data and the obtrusive explanation of abstruse operations with more entertainment and readability.

# Character: 6/9. The protagonist was a talented problem-solver facing a series of extreme circumstances about life and death with an optimistic philosophy of "work the problem". However much I love the resourcefulness of the protagonist in face of various conundrums, it was unbearable for me to appreciate this guy's monologue and other sometimes distorted characters all the time.

# World and Others: 7/9. One of the biggest problems in writing a replicate of the real world is its mundaneness or triviality (and this is why the comedians and the humourists are great jobs), which was fully demonstrated in this book despite Weir's laborious effort in remedying this shortcoming of the constant first person perspective with his clumsy and nerdy jokes.
Here, in addition, are some conceivable speculative loopholes:

## Water
Why didn't the protagonist calculate the heat scientifically, evaluate the potential high risk and make up corresponding remedies before making such a dangerous fire experiment in the one and only Hab?

The fact that he's not a chemist was absolutely not a rightful excuse to avoid learning the necessary chemistry in advance instead of just performing a dangerous experiment himself brusquely, considering how adequate the time and resources he enjoyed!

In reality, he would definitely have died of this procedure, which made me feel more unrealistic than the unlikely Martian sandstorm, let alone the exhaling oxygen that fortunately exploded when the hydrogen was nearly exhausted.

## Fire
Why did NASA, who had not equipped them with lighters, provide them with materials of handmade bombs?
