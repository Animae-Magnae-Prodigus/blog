# Plot: 8/9. The typical pattern of the narrative of this book was basically like that: The protagonist faced the problem and came up with several plans along with reasonable speculations, which he then tested or executed them in extremely unnecessary, redundant, and tedious details. Sometimes it went wrong and incurred a new problem, so as to repeat this pattern... Chapters involving the narratives from the third person perspective were more tolerable.

## Chapter 1: Sol 6. Begin
The narrator was stranded on Mars alone since his teammates thought him dead and therefore returned to the Earth in no time.

## Chapter 2: Sol 7-Sol 22. List out the inventory:
+ Food:
	+ 400-Day rations with enough nutrients
	+ The narrator occupied himself in growing potatoes that may extend his life 90 days or so.
+ Water:
	+ A running reclaimer without backup
	+ Most of 300 liters of stored water was planned to cultivate the potato.
+ Gas: An oxygenator with a short-term spare
+ Energy: 200M^2^ solar cells
+ Communication: The broken radio array was unredeemable.
+ Transportation: Two rovers and five suits with 1500 hours' worth of CO~2~ filters
+ Salvation: The possible landing of Ares 4 four years later

## Chapter 3: Sol 25-Sol 30. Food
He extended the arable farmland by using rovers' pop-tents and other vacancies in the Hab so that he might survive despite the long-term starvation.

## Chapter 4: Sol 32-Sol 37. Water {#c4}
He hooked the fuel plant of MAV up to Hab's oxygenator for the oxygen, and ran the hydrazine, the fuel of MDV, over a catalyst for the hydrogen. He used a wooden cross to ignite oxygen, a spacesuit to store water and several plastic bags to build up a chimney of controlling hydrogen.

However, during the experiment, he was unnoticed of the existence of the other oxygen tank, and therefore the tricky overflow of hydrogen in the atmosphere of Hab.

## Chapter 5: Sol 38-Sol 41. Water
He hibernated his bacteria by lowering the room temperature and bamboozled the atmospheric regulator into extracting all the oxygen in the room so as to burn off the remaining hydrogen bit by bit. Despite the minor explosion caused by the oxygen he exhaled, he managed to get rid of the overflowed hydrogen.

## Chapter 6: Sol ?. NASA found him alive.
Venkat, the director of this project, persuaded NASA's administrator, Teddy, to investigate the condition of the protagonist's cadaver for the sake of more grants from Congress after Teddy's two-month procrastination for fear of the subsequent PR issue. However, NASA found the protagonist still alive and therefore informed the public of this news.

Although they promised to try their best to save the protagonist in public, yet NASA could not communicate with the protagonist owing to the broken communication array, Teddy didn't agree to risk the other astronauts' life for the protagonist and he even commanded to conceal this thing from the returning astronauts.

## Chapter 7: Sol 63-Sol 68. Energy and transportation
In order to reach Ares 4, 3200km away from the camp, on his own, he transformed one of the rovers by equipping it with the battery of the other and solar plates for energy. After a failed experiment, he decided to have recourse to the dangerous RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator) for cheap heat.

## Chapter 8: Sol?
Kapoor, the director of Mars operation for NASA, was interviewed by CNN and announced that they were monitoring Mark closely and would try their best to bring him home. They finally figured out the propose of Mark's latest sojourn was to find the dilapidated Pathfinder and build connection with the Earth.

(The suspense of this chapter and reactions from the Earth were so great that it is a pity to find the next chapter again abounded with the harangue of our protagonist.)

## Chapter 9: Sol 79-Sol 83. Communication
The protagonist found the Pathfinder after a seven-day exploration and managed to load it up to the car with a handmade slope.

## Chapter 10: Sol 90-Sol 96. Communication
The protagonist brought the Pathfinder back safe and sound before he repaired it to wait for any positive feedback from the side of the Earth.

## Chapter 11: Sol 97-Sol 98. Communication
The protagonist first communicated with the Earth by sending the picture of his written words and reading the spelt ASCII indicated by the rotating remote camera controlled by the Earth.

He then broke his back to transcribe the code of the rover required for building the connection with the Pathfinder. And finally, using the updated pathfinder as the router, he could initiate a more convenient conversation with the Earth.

## Chapter 12: Sol 6-Sol 96. A recount from the third person perspective centering on the other team members before final good news
On their way to the MAV, flying wreckage hit our protagonist, Watney, and carried him away. The commander, Lewis, risked her life to find him alone in the nearly invisible sandstorm responsibly. However, other teammates believed the presumable death of Watney and prompted Louis to catch the final precious opportunity of boarding while the orbital maneuvering system alleviated the severe tipping condition of shuttle, which Louis obeyed eventually.

Four months later, when they heard the breaking news of Watney's survival, Louis reprimanded herself into abandoning Watney behind.

(Maybe things would be better if they had spent some days in checking the corpse of Watney through the satellite in the orbit before heading for home immediately, so that as long as Watney woke up, he could directly ascend to the space by launching the other MAV already deployed on Mars. Of course, the chance that Watney survived in this condition is as infinitesimal as the heavy sandstorm of this kind on Mars, so it is excusable for them to desert him and the planet in no time.)

## Chapter 13: Sol 144-Sol 119. Food: The avulsion of the airlock {#c13}
The canvas of the airlock tore unexpectedly and the Hab's atmosphere breached and throw it forty metres away including an unaware protagonist within it.

## Chapter 14: Sol 119-Sol 122. Food: The avulsion of the airlock
He alighted his hair with the static electricity to patch up a hairline fracture in the airlock before fixing his suit. Due to the leaking of his suit, he chose to roll the airlock back strenuously to the Hab.

After a sound sleep in the collapsed Hab, he reconstructed it. Though his farm was annihilated irrevocably and therefore his current food storage couldn't support him after Sol 584, which meant NASA's previous rescue scheme of picking up him at around Sol 856 must be aborted.

## Chapter 15: Sol 122-Sol?. Food: A futile launch
In order to save the protagonist's life in time, they borrowed a booster from another project and launched it without proper inspection and further testing for the payload, which accounted for the final Waterloo.

## Chapter 16: Sol? The Hermes mutiny {#c16}
China volunteered to offer the NASA a new booster and there existed two options to take advantage of itâ€”a highly risky plan which, however, only put the life of our protagonist at stake, or a more workable plan that may sacrifice the entire crew of Hermes.

Eventually the boss of NASA favoured the former from the perspective of damage control. His subordinate demurring at the decision fugitively sent an email to notify the crew of the plan, who then univocally agreed to risk their lives for their unfortunate teammate and subsequently reset their manoeuvre to make the execution of the later plan a fait accompli.

## Chapter 17: Sol 192-Sol 196. An overhaul of the transportation and the loss of communication {#c17}
This plan required him to drive 3200 kilometers towards the MAV in Schiaparelli and survived away from the Hab for around a hundred sols. He therefore drilled the Rover 1 to accommodate the atmospheric regulator, the oxygenator, and the water reclaimer within it.

But he leaned the drill against the workbench without turning off the power for a more convenient cooling and unexpectedly shorted out the Pathfinder on the workbench. Hence he lost the sole bidirectional means of communication.

## Chapter 18: Sol 197-Sol 211. Preparation for the odyssey #1
For the sake of saving more energy, he dumped the water reclaimer, turned off the oxygenator unless necessary, and retrieved back the RTG to heat the air generated by the atmospheric regulator. He then installed some brackets onto the undercarriage to carry more solar panels. 

## Chapter 19: Sol? Food for the Hermes
Hermes succeeded in capturing the probe smoothly and thus the worst scenario of cannibalism wouldn't come true.

## Chapter 20: Sol 376-Sol 390. Preparation for the odyssey #2 {#20}
He fabricated a more comfortable tent with raisin and cut canvas from the Hab.

## Chapter 21: Sol 431-Sol 449. Run a test and head off to Schiaparelli {#c21}

## Chapter 22: Sol 458-Sol 475. Find the sandstorm during the odyssey
In order to ascertain towards which direction he could bypass the Marth more efficiently, the protagonist clambered up to the rim of the crater, only to find the haze in the east. Plus the lower efficiency of the solar panels recently, he realized immediately that he was located in the peripheral of a sandstorm. 


## Chapter 23: Sol 476-Sol 497. The bypass of the sandstorm and the unexpected turnover of the rovers 
The protagonist devised a contrivance to compare the condition of power loss of different locations at the same time so as to circumvent his old arch-enemy. Unfortunately, after his rovers eventually outran the sandstorm, they got tripped up by an invisible ridge.

## Chapter 24: Sol 498-Sol 504. Arrival {#c25}
The protagonist cost approximately four sols to recover the rovers before reaching the destination.


## Chapter 25: Sol 505-Sol 549. Retrofit of the MAV
NASA, with whom he finally could communicate through the brand-new equipment onboard, commanded him to electrolyse the water so as to fuel the MAV with Hydrogen, and then unload all the non-essential from the ship including control panels, life support, the entire front, and the safety backups, because although these things added up to the odds of launching success, they were too heavy to give him ideal speed matching his teammates.

## Chapter 26: Sol 549 or Mission Day 687. The end
The launch missed so badly that the team had to use the attitude adjuster to close the intercept distance and bombard the VAL to minify the relative velocity. In the end, the protagonist successfully came back to his team.

# Core: 6/9. In a word, it is a good space Robinson science fiction which, however, personally I do not want to read again in light of the excessive amount of the protagonist's repetitive monologues. The book would be better if it narrated all the events instead of only imminent troubles from the third person perspective.
The building of character, the interspersed humor, and the narrative skill especially concerned with the suspense had a great room for improvement so as to flavor the tedious data and the obtrusive explanation of abstruse operations with more entertainment and readability.

# Character: 7/9. The protagonist was a talented problem-solver facing a series of extreme circumstances about life and death with an optimistic philosophy of "work the problem". However much I love the resourcefulness of the protagonist in face of various conundrums, it was unbearable for me to appreciate this guy's monologue all the time.
Though the most impressive person barring the protagonist would be the responsible and smart commander who risked her life in finding a lost teammate at the first and possessed the ingenuity and the audacity to blow their ship in the end.
> "Oh," Louis said, "well if you won't let us thenâ€” wait... Wait a minute... I'm looking at my shoulder patch and it turned out I'm the commander. Sit tight. We are coming to get you."

# World and Others: 7/9. One of the biggest problems in writing a replicate of the real world is its mundaneness or triviality (and this is why the comedians and the humourists are great jobs), which was fully demonstrated in this book despite Weir's laborious effort in remedying this shortcoming of the constant first person perspective with his clumsy and nerdy jokes.
Here, in addition, are some issues or loopholes I disliked:

## [Water](#c4)
Why didn't the protagonist calculate the heat scientifically, evaluate the potential high risk and make up corresponding remedies before making such a dangerous fire experiment in the one and only Hab?

The fact that he's not a chemist was absolutely not a rightful excuse to avoid learning the necessary chemistry in advance instead of just performing a dangerous experiment himself brusquely, considering how adequate the time and resources he enjoyed!

In reality, he would definitely have died of this procedure, which made me feel more unrealistic than the unlikely Martian sandstorm, let alone the exhaling oxygen that fortunately exploded when the hydrogen was nearly exhausted.

## Fire
I doubt NASA didn't provide the lighters  for reliable and professional astronauts just in case.

## [Food](#c13)
NASA was afraid of the sole means of communication and therefore asked the protagonist to learn the Morse code just in case. However, they felt astonishingly okay with the protagonist's sole solution of dealing with the crucial problem on famine by postponing the original plan of sending supplies before Sol 400 to the Sol 856. I don't understand any logic here if it existed.

## [Salvation](#c16)
It's absolutely impossible for a director of China National Space Administration to contact NASA's administrator on his initiative without an approval from his government first. Andy Weir certainly didn't understand the Chinese politics or did some research about it, so he portrayed them just according to his fantastic imagination.

## [Electricity](#c17)
It's not a good habit to cool down the drill or set electric appliances aside without cutting down the power. This accident arose from the protagonist's lack of the consciousness in safely interacting with the electricity. The protagonist should have been thankful in not electrocuting himself accidentally.

## [Tent](#20)
Clearly modifying the tent was not a necessity even though it could provide a good workspace to alleviate some workload in the future. In reality, chances were that his handiwork might not sustain the daily usage or the bizarrely frequent sandstorms because of the lack of NASA's serious testing. Merely several inspections did not suffice and it was definitely safer to use the original version without modification. However, it may be a good idea to create a spare tent from the materials of an useless Hab.

## [Lights](#c24)
I doubt NASA didn't provide any lamps or lights for some extreme emergencies requiring astronauts going out at dark night.
