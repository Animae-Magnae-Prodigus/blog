# Plot: 9/9.
## Chapter 1: Sol 6 begin
The narrator left stranded on Mars alone by teammates who had thought him dead and had returned to the Earth in no time.

## Chapter 2: Sol 7-Sol 22 list out the inventory:
+ Food:
	+ 400-Day rations with enough nutrients
	+ The narrator occupied himself in growing potatoes that may extend his life 90 days or so.
+ Water:
	+ A running reclaimer without backup
	+ Most of 300 liters of stored water was planned to cultivate the potato.
+ Gas: An oxygenator with a short-term spare
+ Energy: 200M^2^ solar cells
+ Communication: The broken radio array was unredeemable.
+ Transportation: Two rovers and five suits with 1500 hours' worth of CO~2~ filters
+ Salvation: The possible landing of Ares 4 four years later

## Chapter 3: Sol 25-Sol 30 food
He extended the arable farmland by using rovers' pop-tents and other vacancies in the Hab so that he might survive despite the long-term starvation.

## Chapter 4: Sol 32-Sol 37 water
He hooked the fuel plant of MAV up to Hab's oxygenator for the oxygen, and ran the hydrazine, the fuel of MDV, over a catalyst for the hydrogen. He used a wooden cross to ignite oxygen, a spacesuit to store water and several plastic bags to build up a chimney of controlling hydrogen.

However, during the experiment, he was unnoticed of the existence of the other oxygen tank, and therefore the tricky overflow of hydrogen in the atmosphere of Hab.

## Chapter 5: Sol 38-Sol 41 Water
He hibernated his bacteria by lowering the room temperature and bamboozled the atmospheric regulator into extracting all the oxygen in the room so as to burn off the remaining hydrogen bit by bit. Despite the minor explosion caused by the oxygen he exhaled, he managed to get rid of the overflowed hydrogen.

## Chapter 6: Sol?
Venkat, the director of this project, persuaded NASA's administrator, Teddy, to investigate the condition of the protagonist's cadaver for the sake of more grants from Congress after Teddy's two-month procrastination for fear of the subsequent PR issue. However, NASA found the protagonist still alive and therefore informed the public of this news.

Although they promised to try their best to save the protagonist in public, yet NASA could not communicate with the protagonist owing to the broken communication array, Teddy didn't agree to risk the other astronauts' life for the protagonist and he even commanded to conceal this thing from the returning astronauts.

## Chapter 7: Sol 63-Sol 68 energy and transportation
In order to reach Ares 4, 3200km away from the camp, on his own, he transformed one of the rovers by equipping it with the battery of the other and solar plates for energy. After a failed experiment, he decided to have recourse to the dangerous RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator) for cheap heat.

## Chapter 8: Sol?
Kapoor, the director of Mars operation for NASA, was interviewed by CNN and announced that they were monitoring Mark closely and would try their best to bring him home. They finally figured out the propose of Mark's latest sojourn was to find the dilapidated Pathfinder and build connection with the Earth.

(The suspense of this chapter and reactions from the Earth were so great that it is a pity to find the next chapter again abounded with the harangue of our protagonist.)

## Chapter 9: Sol 79-Sol 83 communication
The protagonist found the Pathfinder after a seven-day exploration and managed to load it up to the car with a handmade slope.

## Chapter 10: Sol 90-Sol 96 communication
The protagonist brought the Pathfinder back safe and sound before he repaired it to wait for any positive feedback from the side of the Earth.

## Chapter 11: Sol 97-Sol 98 communication
The protagonist first communicated with the Earth by sending the picture of his written words and reading the spelt ASCII indicated by the rotating remote camera controlled by the Earth.


He then broke his back to transcribe the code of the rover required for building the connection with the Pathfinder. And finally, using the updated pathfinder as the router, he could initiate a more convenient conversation with the Earth.

# Core: 8/9. The protagonist was a talented problem-solver facing a series of extreme circumstances about life and death with an optimistic philosophy of "work the problem".
## Water
Why didn't the protagonist calculate the heat scientifically, evaluate the potential high risk and make up corresponding remedies before making such a dangerous fire experiment in the one and only Hab?

The fact that he's not a chemist was absolutely not a rightful excuse to avoid learning the necessary chemistry in advance instead of just performing a dangerous experiment himself brusquely, considering how adequate the time and resources he enjoyed!

In reality, he would definitely have died of this procedure, which made me feel more unrealistic than the unlikely Martian sandstorm, let alone the exhaling oxygen that fortunately exploded when the hydrogen was nearly exhausted.

# Fire
Why did NASA, who had not equipped them with lighters, provide them with materials of handmade bombs?

+ Food:
+ Gas:
+ Energy:
+ Communication:

# Character: 6/9. However much I love the resourcefulness of the protagonist in face of various conundrums, it was unbearable for me to appreciate this guy's monologue and other sometimes distorted characters all the time.
The building of character, the interspersed humor, and the narrative skill especially concerned with the suspense had great improvement room so as to flavor the tedious data and the obtrusive explanation of abstruse operations with more entertainment and readability.

# World and Others: 7/9. One of the biggest problems in writing a replicate of the real world is its mundaneness or triviality (and this is why the comedian and the humourist are great jobs), which was fully demonstrated in this book despite Weir's laborious effort in remedying this shortcoming with his clumsy and nerdy jokes.
