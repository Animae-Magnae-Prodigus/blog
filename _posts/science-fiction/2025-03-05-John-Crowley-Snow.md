# Plot: 4/9. 
After the death of his wife Georgie, the hero was determined to watch the video recorded automatically and faithfully by a wasp buzzing around Georgie all the time when she was alive. However, the playing of video turned out to be completely random, unsearchable, and uncontrollable, its resolution became more and more blurry, and the context always focused on the topic of winter because of the materials used for storage.

So in the end, after hearing the suggestion that "let the dead bury the dead", the hero stopped watching the incoherent and shoddy recording, and relied more on his own sudden reminiscence of Georgie.

# Core: 6/9. I'm accustomed to writing down thoughts whenever I encountered with something thought-provoking but seldom did I review them, that's why I understood the logic of the hero:
The essence of memory was its ability of reprocessing and interpreting the past events that was tedious and dark in most of time so as to alleviate the bearer and correct their present behaviour. And therefore a monomania in the past, unprocessed, raw materials was actually a treason to the present life.

**All in all, don't overindulge yourself in the past memory.**

# Character: 3/9. If only Crowley had depicted more on the ups and downs of Georgie, the "crazy, wasteful, happy" woman that the hero loved from the perspective of recordings rather than constantly rendering some mundane fragments.

# World and Others: 3/9.
