# Plot: 2/9. A reclusive poet saved the Earth. But this story could serve the best bad example of writing.
+ Half of the article described the protagonist's life tediously and ostentatiously.
+ The crisis came without sense of danger at first for readers barring a minor annoyance from the poet.
+ The introduction of the danger was given tediously from people in a spaceship just escaped from the robots on Earth.
+ The antagonist was so weak that they was defeated immediately, which dwarfed the ability of the Earth.



# Core: 0/9. Sorry, I can sense nothing special except Merritt's biggest ego in the world. It's ridiculous that robots couldn't create the art if it could control the government.



# Character: 1/9. All the characters were created for the protagonist only. He's the egocentric God in this egotistical story.



# World and Others: 1/9. Unrealistic nonsense.



# Overall: 1/9. Why did Vandermeer put a fiction that was a part of round-robin novel here?
