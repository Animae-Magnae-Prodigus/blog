# Core: 0/9
Sorry, but the title of this book seems to have nothing to do with the context of the book. Is it because of Miki's last rebellion against its owner? The author didn't tell anything about it. Does she forget it?

Also I'm no longer attracted by Murderbot who are more and more like human and the book lacks novel and interesting science fantasy.

# Character: 6/9.
Miki: An innocent pet robot or a gull who loves its owner, Abene, and believes any human and robots who claims to protect Abene. It seems to presume Murderbot as its first bot friend and sacrificed itself to help Murderbot deal with the combat bot.

Abene: The leader of the investigation team who instructs and treats Miki so benevolently and tenderly that makes Murderbot jealousy.

GreyCris: It served as the antagonist again and played it well.

Other human: No impressive behavior. It would be better if Martha Wells learn how to use smart dialogues to build characters and allot more time to represent characters there rather than Murderbot's endless useless chatter.

# Plot: 7/9. Complete within my expectation.

## Prelude
+ Murderbot intended to find some evidence against GreyCris to help Mensah. So it had to board a shuttle full of contract-labor-bound passengers and involuntarily served as relationship counselor. 

+ Murderbot had to beguile Miki, a pet bot, into believing that it was deployed secretly to protect its owner so as to steal onboard without drawing personnel's attention.

## Rescue Task
+ Murderbot protected Abene, Miki's owner, from being abducted in time after it had collected the required evidence. Abene commanded them to save Hirune who was just carried off by the combat bots.

+ Murderbot cooperated with Wilken, one of the hired guardians, to immobilize a combat bot. 

+ Wilken attempted to persuade Abene to use Murderbot as a bait against drones and the remaining combat bot so as to kill Abene without scruple. But luckily, the combat bot disappeared and Murderbot managed to hack the hostile drones and Wilken's armor just in time. They conjectured that their so-called guardians were dispatched surreptitiously by GreyCris to destroy tractor array and disintegrate this area by sending encrypted signal to the bot.

+ Murderbot and Abene lured crew out of the shuttle to paralyze the other guardian. 

## Conclusion
+ The shuttle bumped the zipper off its course to save the tractor array. However, the combat bot seized the opportunity to invade the shuttle. Miki disobeyed its owner's direct order to protect its friends and eventually sacrificed itself for Murderbot to annihilate the mighty invader.

+ Murderbot hacked another ship to bring the evidence to Dr. Mensah in person after hearing Abene's crying.

# World and others: 6/9
Things would be more dramatic if the author is able to give more details on trivial cases Murderbot managed to deal with and render information on that world through them.

I'm a bit disappointed when she skipped lots of descriptions on magnificent dynamic scenes like using a shuttle to bumble the zipper off its track.

I thought the storm mentioned a few times was the presage of a crumbling tractor array triggered by the encrypted signal. But its final boss was just a combat bot rather than the catastrophe of a planet. Had to say that both the guardians and the combat bot were procrastinators.


# Overall: 5/9
