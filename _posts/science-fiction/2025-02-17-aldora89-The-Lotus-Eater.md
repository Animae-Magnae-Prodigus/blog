# Plot: 7/9. It's a really excellent yet gratuitous work on [ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/277853), though before beginning this work, make sure that you have read through all its warning tags including the explicit description of homosexual relationship between males.

Gates, the captain of Galapagos, asked Kirk, her former student at the academy and also the captain of enterprise, to rescue her lost team on the planet Sigma Nox several days ago. Kirk and McCoy found Talyor, their ex-classmate, was on that list. 

Gates' attempt to tag along with Kirk and Spock was stymied by McCoy and her science officer Brady requested they contacted him as long as they found Kallie Lombard.

On their exploration, had it not been for the prompt of McCoy and Kirk, Spock wouldn't realize a possible favor towards him of his teammate Morgan who afterwards became the first to find Gates' unconscious biologist Phillips lying on the ground of the exotic forest.

McCoy reported Phillips' receptor didn't pick up acetylcholine, an unknown compound messed with his limbic system, and overall he seemed like had a bender. Granted that Gates' team got themselves misplaced following sunset, McCoy expected them to return immediately, which of course dismissed by Kirk who worried about the dwindling window of action.

So all crew except Spock were commanded back to the ship leaving Spock and Kirk
 two in the rainforest. Momentarily following the sunset, when Spock was about to report an unusual signal he received, only to find Kirk just disappeared behind his back.

Spock immediately contacted Nyota who detected Kirk's communicator was moving fast several hundred meters away. Spock got after it hurriedly only to find a communicator intentionally disabled by its owner abnormally. Scott informed him of the unusual electrical interference, yet Spock was determined to stay there until his captain was found.

Luckily, Spock caught his somnambulating captain who was totally bewildered by his own action before being brought around by Spock as well as Kallie Lombard, one of Gates' missing crew, who was heading for the same direction like the previously possessed captain.

In intermittent signals, they realized a strange spaceship attacked their ships like a bolt out of the blue sky, leading to the loss of Galapagos and the retreat of Entrepreneur. Meanwhile, the circumstance of vanishing Kirk obliged vexed Spock to let out Lombard for the destination.

The culprit turned out to be Bulbweed, the largest angiospermous plant on the planet of which Spock struggled to save Kirk from the maw intact, by using his body to bear the annoying stings and clamps of enormous noxious Cattlebugs.

In the next morning, when Spock went out to search for edible food, Kirk regained his consciousness gradually, checked the electronics, and collected the kindling. After Spock brought souvenirs back and managed to light the fire, they ate their first dinner together on this godforsaken planet for the first time.

## 4
Watching Kirk's listless mental state day by day sapped by his nightly possession, Spock felt obliged to put aside his vegetarianism and hunt animals for better nutrition to his captain. The self-accomplishment and thrills reminded him of his previous ostracism by his paternal tribe owing to his once savage attack against one innocent tribesman.

Kirk was responsible for cooking and mending, and he once found a luminous artificial object surrounding the planet which was supposed to be the abandoned Galapagos. 

Their raised Cattlebugs died of the ongoing separation from their coexisting Bulbweed, boding ill for the prospect of the captain.


## 5
Kirk found an ancient dome under the hill which would possibly be, deduced from the mural, left behind by bipods who shepherded Cattlebugs centuries ago.

To keep up Spock's spirit, Kirk proposed to make the disinfectant from the local materials he just found. 

Upon observing the meteor, they set off for its crashing place.

## 6
Beside one swollen steam caused by the constant rain, Spock replied to his inquisitive captain that it was the emotional incompatibility that led to his previous breakup.

Suddenly they found unconscious Talyor whom Kirk was determined to tend for despite Spock's opposition that it was highly likeable that Talyor's brain was damaged so severely by the compound of Bulbweed that he could not survive the cut-out. Eventually, to confirm his theory as well as comfort guilty Kirk who had to kill an old-day friend with his own hands, Spock autopsied Talyor's brain and found the lethal lesions. As a response, Jim hugged and thanked Spock. 

When they watched a clear Milky Way in the sky for the first time, Spock paid more attention to his rapturous captain's expression rather than the resplendent space.


When a giant, tough mantis attacked, paralyzed and devoured Spock, Kirk who always followed Spock clandestinely these days to let out his better energy, rescued Spock in time, merely because the mantis was so repellent of the taste of Kirk's muscle that it escaped immediately and abandoned its souvenirs strangely. 

Kirk demanded Spock to enter his healing trance and Spock obeyed reluctantly.

## 7
Kirk almost got killed when he tended to impeded the unnecessary attack from fight-fogged Spock who indulged himself in the spree of the massacre at the bare sight of a giant lizard approaching his captain, because, as it turned out from their communication, the lizard called Longclaw, the only survivor of an expedition team from another advanced civilisation, had no inimical intention to speaking species.

Spock confessed recently all the times he lost control albeit his strict discipline since childhood incident were related to Kirk. Kirk acknowledged Spock's apology and even consoled distraught Spock that he actually made a substantial progress in controlling himself judged from the different consequences of his previous two emotional breakdowns.
## 8
In order to approach Galapagos in extremely hot geothermal fields, they were determined to make a thermal protection suit and Spock volunteered to adventure into the literal hell because of his innate thermo-regulatory structure.

Subsequent to many failed attempts, they found the ideal material would possibly be the armor of the aforementioned mantis which was called Snapnecks by Longclaw perhaps owing to their weakness of their brittle necks exposed out while they were snapping.
On their way to the hunt, Kirk dared Spock to kiss him and Spock did, much to Kirk's surprise.

## 9
Immediately after Kirk came to from an failed hunting of Snapneck, Longclaw led him to rescue Spock who were abducted to Snapnecks' den.

Not only comatose Spock but also Kallie Lombard's remains was hangings on the branches of the den. 

Kirk managed to kill the male with the assistance of Longclaw and released Spock from the web. But Bulbweed again tried to influence his mentality at the very same moment that a more potent female was about to came back.

In such a delirium, he sensed some fragmentary memories belonging to his alternative self including a scene that his other self was kissing his own Spock for in that universe they were apparently a mate.



## 10
As soon as the shock of falling on the ground brought Spock back to full consciousness, he got back the enthralled captain. Meanwhile, Longclaw bound the required carcass to her back and thus the two began their stampede from the female fury. In the end, all of them were safe and sound fortunately save for Kirk's fever and Longclaw's laceration.
Before long, furnished with the suit that nearly cost both of their lives, Spock succeeded in getting through the scorching geysers, only to find the nacelle unapproachable because of the astonishingly high temperature caused by the crater in which it buried.

In great disappointment and pessimism about their future, Spock suggested on his own initiative drinking down the sorrow and frustration with the remaining alcohol and Kirk concurred.

## 11
They visited another old relics and realized from its basic infrastructure that once the brainless Cattlebugs were actually an intelligent species who were somehow mentally controlled by the invaders Bulbweed centuries ago. 

Longclaw carried their luggage here so that they spent next weeks in decoding their language and researching the operating system of alien spaceships. Several failed takeoffs edified Spock to connect them three with his capability of psychical meld so as to drive the spaceship more smoothly. 
Their final departure from the planet coincided with a similar space chase in the beginning between Entrepreneur searching for their lost crews and the sentinels of Cattlebugs which had destroyed both Galapagos and the original ships of Longclaw. If they could not reach Entrepreneur in time, they would be trapped in the crossfire.

At this very moment, Longclaw showed her excellent talent in muscle memory and accomplished the space wrap towards Entrepreneur in thirty seconds. 

They finally came home.



## 12
They were greeted by their unbelievable colleagues including McCoy who discovered Bulbweed could release two types of chemicals targeting in organisms holding hemoglobin or similar iron-based proteins: One was able to hack the acetylcholine receptors through direct contact to cause the death of victims during withdraw, and the other wrenching into the limbic systems was only emitted in the night to attract victims to approach the former chemical.
Observing captain's chronic health issue as well as posttraumatic syndrome, Spock proposed a healing vacation for they two in his hometown where Spock declared to his people that the teaching of masters was no longer suitable to him and hinted he would mate with Kirk like his parents.


## 13
Even after accepting the obliteration of additional memories messing him up all the time, Kirk still said yea to his own message questioning whether he was in love with Spock.

## 14
Kirk made it with Spock but they reached the concurrence of keeping it quiet until they were caught for the banning of an intimate relationship in workplace.

# Core: 6/9. To my way of thinking, it would perhaps be more appropriate if the plot could be spiced up with more heartbreaking conundrums to confide their bondings in a more desperate circumstances.



# Character: 7/9. In spite of the humorous banters, witty puns and fabulous reactions throughout the context, the background of most characters and their individual development seemed to be obscure especially regarding the process how Spock realized he should downplays the discipline he imbued with from childhood up and the reason why Longclaw didn't miss to return her hometown. 
It also embodied large potential in improving the building of minor characters such as the intention of the unfriendly General and the response of friends and families towards their relationship.




# World and Others: 6/9. Though the configuration of Bulbweed was fascinating indeed, the mystery of their appearance, the history of Cattlebugs, and the local biodiversity were not fully disclosed.



# Overall: 7/9. To sum up, I would give a higher score if the author could blended their survival into the other two courses of exploration and romance in a more thorough manner. Nevertheless It's an amazing masterpiece considering the identity of fan-fiction.
