# Plot: 3/9. This story showed an extremely good example about the bad storytelling such as unattractive characters, too much boring psychological monologue of the middle-aged protagonist, and most importantly, the omission of the presentation of a serious crisis. While checking the author's background, I am not surprised he did not become a popular, mainstream writer.

The storyline was about a father driving a station wagon to carry all of his family out of an imminent crisis. However, most of his family seemed to be unaware of the gravity of the situation and kept doubting the necessity of his strict management during their flee, which prompted him to desert them all except the daughter.



# Core: 6/9. it was reminiscent of the barbarism of the Bible.



# Character: 2/9. I hate the typical stereotype.




# World and Others: 0/9. I didn't understand the intention of avoiding forward description of the crisis and others' reaction towards it. If the police, the news agency, and the workers in the gas station still fulfilled their duty, it was unlikely the civilization was ending.
