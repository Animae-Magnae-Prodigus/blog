# Plot: 4/9. How could Detaxalans be unheard of mental power from males on Gola? How could daughters of Gola not revenge back?
Detaxalans wanted to force people on Gola to commence with them like what white people had done for other people hundred years ago. Their first attempt of violence was failed. So Detaxalan slaves plotted a rebellion with males on Gola. But Detaxalans were unaware of females' mental power, so they were controlled by females and thus ended the second invasion of Gola.

# Core: 2/9. It's a bit interesting to narrate the story from the perspective of a female-dominated civilization. Though I don't think it different from male-dominated civilization. Both worlds are nasty and superficial from the context. I could not resonate with these aliens.

# Character: 0/9. I would give a higher score if Stone could not write the scene that when Matriarch was hold by a strong Detaxalan male, she felt a kind of pleasure. It's impossible and out of character. How could a male on Earth feel he was happy when he was controlled by a strong woman who was about to kill him? And I thought the previous matriarch was so foolish that she did nothing to those three invasions and Detaxalans had nearly won!

# World and Others: 3/9. The only thing I'm sure was the ability and appearance of daughters on Gola. Stone didn't intend to give more concrete details on daughters' world. For example, what on Earth was Detaxalans eager for?



# Overall: 2/9. It's an insult to feminism.
