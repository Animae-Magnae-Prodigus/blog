# Plot: 5/9. 
After witnessing how T'Gatoi, an alien friend of the Terran family who was the Tlic government official in charge of the Terran Preserve, vivisected an alive Terran to help him labor Tlic babies, the hero was so nauseated at the bloody operation that he came out of the house to vomit, which was sensed by his elder brother who then confessed that his last failed attempt of escaping Preserve was owing to have once accidentally watched a Tlic kill a Terran host to feed her own children from the inside out. 

Out of extreme terror, the hero thus threatened T'Gatoi not to impregnate him by staking his own life, yet bent his mind to protect his sister from the fate. In the end, the hero accepted the injection, although he was determined to enjoy the right of maintaining guns as allegedly Gatoi's partner, and kept asking whether Gatoi cared about he was the one or not, which, of course, didn't make for any positive response except the alien's regret of possibly losing her kids and her own life in the incident just now.

# Core: 8/9. Butler amplified and transformed some women's painstaking and powerless complications in undignified labor and loveless marriages just for some men's inherent requirement of procreation in our own era onto men themselves during the time of colonial domination by aliens in an artful and revolutionary manner. 

# Character: 5/9. 

# World and Others: 5/9. 

# Overall: 6/9.
