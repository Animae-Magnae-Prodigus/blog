# Plot: 4/9. It's an anticlimactic and lackluster adventure, weighed down by the protagonist's monotone harangue.
When the protagonist tried to destroy an ag-bot to rescue Iris and their other teammates, a B-E SecUnit shot the ag-bot directly without any concern about the protagonist's safety. Iris then thanked Dellcourt, the leader of this B-E contingent, for their help.

When the protagonist's team wanted to persuade factions on the colony to reject the malicious salvage of B-E who aimed at taking over this planet, they were amazed to learn that there existed a reclusive group of separatists living at the pole near the terraforming engine.

So they landed there and the protagonist explored the found hatchway, where they communicated with the system of that colony called AdaCol2, only to discover unfortunately that B-E's men had already reached them.


Although the separatists invited the protagonist's team into their basement, their diplomat grudged their words to the protagonist's team. What's more, the head of this B-E's contingent, Leonide, asked for a meeting of negotiation. But she kept ridiculously accusing the protagonist's group of persuading the colonists to stay so as to record the influence of contamination on the colonists, before the protagonist realized the separatists had been spying their whole conversation.

Desperate to convince the separatists of B-E's danger, the protagonist made a video warning them not to sign exploitative contracts with B-E and asked AdaCol2 to upload it to its public channel as a gift. It worked somehow, because the separatists requested both of them to leave.

In the second meeting Leonide initiated with the protagonist's team before their departure, the protagonist helped Leonide to escape an assassination attempt by her subordinates. Leonide told them there existed a schism within the leadership, and the hawks—currently arriving on two ships—wanted to annihilate her to just launch an invasion of this planet brutally.

So with the assistance of ART, the protagonist guarded her and his own team out of the basement and reunited with the group. They and ART respectively took down a SecUnit dispatched by B-E. One SecUnit however turned out to be a rogue and simply let the protagonist go. In the end, B-E's plot failed with their own schismatic business occupied and the protagonist continued to travel with ART.


# Character: 6/9. It just highlights the protagonist and ART heavily, eclipsing the other teammates and the colonists as usual.



# World and Others: 5/9. I felt the alien exploration real, detailed and convincing but boring. In addition, several potentially intriguing elements—such as the colony factions and the separatists' culture—remained untouched.



# Core: 4/9. So what's the meaning of the *system collapse*? Martha Wells always named her novel with meaningless title disconnected from the actual events.
