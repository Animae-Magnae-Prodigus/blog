# Core: 4/9. I like the impact subgenre because I think it hard to imagine and write out the scenes of catastrophe coming outside the Earth. Although this is a commonplace topic.


# Character: 2/9. The only one memorable is the mathematician. This work intentionally weakened humanity. I don't think that the scientists who are aware of mathematician's precise calculation will not push government and public.


# Plot: 4/9. Clearly the plain description without details on humanity could not stir my interest.
On the first day of the New Year, Neptune became very erratic and thus scientists found the strange planetary body. By the second day it's visible to any decent instrument. Then it collided with Neptune which now rose like a pygmy moon in the night.

People found it filed newer to the Earth,and a mathematician calculated that the star would be deflected by Jupiter into an elliptical path towards the sun and meanwhile have a close distance with the Earth. Thus the master mathematician prophesied a series of natural catastrophes on Earth. In short, "man has lived in vain."

People ridiculed his words and did as are their wont adovcating common sense until it indeed came closer and catastrophes then infested the Earth. It then passed the Earth, leaving survivors a planet replete with devastation everywhere.


# World and Others: 6/9. This work focuses on how the star influenced the Earth at the macro level especially disasters and phenomenum it caused.


# Overall: 4/9. Well was an earnest writer from my perspective and I thought this work was a masterpiece in his era.
