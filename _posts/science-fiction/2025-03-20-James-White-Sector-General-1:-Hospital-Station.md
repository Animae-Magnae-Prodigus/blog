# Plot: 5/9. It was made up of several discontinuous chapters each of which told a main case where the author affectedly withheld much of the information abruptlyâ€”the lowest way to create suspense.
1. O'Mara managed to deal with an ailing alien baby along with a superior begrudging him, and accordingly secured a job in the Hospital.
2. Conway misused the tape, dispelled the invading harassment while maintaining his own principle, overcame his prejudice against the military and the violence.
3. Conway helped a stuck-up doctor to edify an alien dinosaur about the teleportation. So the dinosaur could escape from the climatic catastrophe in its habitat in the near future.
4. Conway and his new alien assistant called Prilicla rescued fellow doctors from the toxic gas in time, and eventually cooperated to catch a young, amorphous and deranged shape-shifter barging about the hospital unscrupulously.
5. Conway discounted others' opinions in treating the unknown disease of an unknown alien rescued from a crashed ship and kept the reason in secret because of his own uncertainty. It turned out that his presumption and action were right, for the disease was actually a normal symptom of this species's natural metamorphosis.

# Core: 6/9. I'd like to read more stories on distinctive and talented aliens cooperating with the protagonist to conquer tricky problems of intergalactic patients together in a comprehensive hospital.

# Character: 4/9. I originally anticipated more heartwarming  interactions with loveable colleagues or memorable alien patients, particularly like the witty badinage between Conway and his bad-tempered superior O'Mara:
> O'Mara, "I wouldn't trust you with my appendix."
> Conway, "I have got your lousy appendix... It's on my bookcase."

# World and Others: 5/9.
