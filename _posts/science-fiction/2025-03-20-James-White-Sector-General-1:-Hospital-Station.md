# Plot: 5/9. It was made up of several discontinuous chapters each of which representing a story.
1. O'Mara managed to deal with an ailing alien baby along with a superior begrudging him, and accordingly got a job in the Hospital.
2. Conway misused the tape, dispelled the invading harassment while maintaining his own principle, overcame his prejudice on the military and the violence.
3. Conway helped a stuck-up doctor to edify an alien dinosaur learn teleportation so as to avoid the climatic catastrophe of dinosaurs in the near future.
4. Conway and his new alien assistant Prilicla rescued other doctors in time from the toxic gas, and eventually caught a young, amorphous and deranged shape-shifter barging about the hospital unscrupulously.
5. Conway discounted others' opinions in treating the unknown disease of an unknown alien rescued from a crashed ship and kept the reason in secret from others because of his own uncertainty. It turned out that his presumption and action was right that the disease was actually a normal symptom of its racial metamorphosis.

# Core: 6/9. I'm glad to find distinctive, talented aliens cooperate with the protagonist to conquer tricky problems together.

# Character: 4/9. 

# World and Others: 6/9.
