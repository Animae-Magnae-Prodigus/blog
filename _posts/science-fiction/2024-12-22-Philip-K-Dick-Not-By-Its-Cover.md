# Plot: 2/9. It's interesting to see the naughty wub again. But it had a boring storyline. I would give a higher score if it ended with Masters would like to a coat made up of wub fur to live forever, but was possessed therefore by the wub. Thus it also echoed the quatrain, "Our stint on earth doth herald an unstopping bliss."
Masters, the president of a publisher, found that the context bound in the wub-fur was intentionally altered by the wub who was still alive in the form of fur. After finding wub's powerful capability of preservation, Masters decided to enclose his corpse with wub fur in the coffin and waited to see what happens after centuries.

# Core: 3/9. It depicted a unique space creature who enjoyed its immortality and even immobility but it was not much fun. One could not judge a book from its cover, and one could not judge a wub from its hide.

# Character: 2/9. The wub here was not interesting. I would give a higher score if it could give a much more witty comments on context rather than making childish graffito. Meanwhile, did all the wub-fur books change context at the same time in the same manner?

# World and Others: 1/9. I sensed no difference from the real world. And it even used galleys on Mars to print books. Awful.



# Overall: 2/9. Why did most sequels of short science fiction I have ever read appear worse than the original?
