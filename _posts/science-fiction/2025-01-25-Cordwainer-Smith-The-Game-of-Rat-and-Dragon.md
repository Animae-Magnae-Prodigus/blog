# Plot: 2/9. The upper half of this article dumped you information on the world-building without any plot! The space opera forced people to cooperate with their cats against the dragons. It's a complete story describing how the hero drew his cat and beat the enemy successfully, yet it couldn't strike the right chord of mine under the condition that I extremely like this kind of science fiction. I would give a higher score if it could trigger my curiosity or drew my attention more intensely.


# Core: 2/9. I would like to read a space opera with more suspense and drama if it didn't hold any depth. What do you expect from space opera?



# Character: 3/9. The heroine here was just a she-cat, so it's a little creepy actually when I read those:

> Woodley said:
> I've seen more pinlighters go crazy from monkeying around with Partners than I have ever seen could by the rat.



> He even thought he caught the edge of a longing... 

> A very flattering and joining thought: What a pity he is not a cat.


> Where would he ever find a woman who could compare with her?

# World and Others: 1/9. What do you expect from space opera? Logic? Complicate and verbose jargons didn't mean a good world-building actually.
What cause the dragon to appear and how did they live and propagate? Why did they have to hunt people? Did they have intelligence? What did they like and eat? What was their physiology?

How did people find out their pet cats can be used for their partners? Why did people not choose more precise machines or other animals? What kinda culture did they have?

How did people get the telepathy?  Talent or discipline? How far? How long? How often? Why could only the telepath sense and fight the dragon? What was the history of telepaths?

# Overall: 2/9. I don't like Cordwainer Smith because of his weak writing ability especially on fighting scenes and world-building and his weird lust after cats. If his next work I will read is still so unbearable to me, then I will block him forever.
