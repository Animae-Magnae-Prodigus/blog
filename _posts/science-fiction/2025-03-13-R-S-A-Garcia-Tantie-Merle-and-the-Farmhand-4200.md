# Plot: 3/9.
The narrator received an AI adjutant that could help her do any household except taking care of the goat which was always inclined to eat the adjutant as a whole. 

In the end, the narrator pardoned its fault and expressed her love towards it, which actuated the moving AI to find an accompany to the lonely goat and thus solve the problem.

# Core: 2/9. I was nauseated by the configuration of the anthropomorphic AI who was set to be more capable than human and have the same emotion and feelings as human, yet felt indebted to human's kindness hidden behind slavery, injustice, and atrocities.

# Character: 4/9. 

# World and Others: 2/9.
