# Core: 2/9. Aliens on Venus solved their problems on lands which might be a good topic, but depicted in a childish way. I think it's more fantastic fiction than science fiction. I didn't saw anywhere it's related to real science.


# Character: 1/9. Knax used his intelligence to solve problems and others didn't even have a name. What did you expect from a fairy tale?


# Plot: 2/9. Conflicts and solutions are childish and simple.
Two contrastingly different kinds of creatures existed on both sides of Venus. One were chubby and unhurried turtles, the other were vital and dynamic creatures with twenty arms.

Knax wanted to have enough space for a walk on turtles' territory, so they made balloons out of the craters and star's exterior. But their invention hindered turtles sunlight and left turtles only shades. Knax cracked their nocturnal problem by using longer cords for the balloons.



# World and Others: 0/9. What did you expect from a fairy tale?


# Overall: 1/9. Terrible.
