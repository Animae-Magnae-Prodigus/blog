# Plot: 6/9. 
## 0 
After being rejected by the Avengers, Deadpool became a mundane salesman selling cars with Paul and sulking over his girlfriend's leaving. When friends were celebrating his birthday, he was abruptly abducted by Mr. Paradox, an officer of TVA, who was here to offer Deadpool a job. He also informed Deadpool that there was no need for him to go home, because Deadpool's universe lost its anchor being, Wolverine, and was therefor going to wither in thousands of years later. So Paradox thought it was considerable of him to expedite this ending by launching the ripper several days later.

refusing this tragic fate, Deadpool robbed Paradox of his gadget, returned to his original universe, and dug Wolverine's grave up, only to confirm that Wolverine of this universe was indeed dead. Out of disappointment or entertainment, he just desecrated Wolverine's carcass by using its remains as weapons to mow down Paradox's pursuing henchmen one by one, before he traveled through different universes to find a suitable substitute for Wolverine.

When Deadpool finally handed an available yet disheartening Wolverine over to Paradox, Paradox derided that this Wolverine was too bad to redeem the universe, and subsequently threw the duo directly to the void. after landing,  Wolverine, reluctant to help Deadpool, fought him ferociously, until Deadpool lied that TVA could change the time and undo Wolverine's past mistakes, which certainly struck the right chord of Wolverine.

But then, they were captured by Cassandra Nova, the malevolent sister of the duo's mutual acquaintance, Xavier, and barely escaped from the maw of a monster called Alioth.

After dining, they met Nicepool, the owner of Dogpool, who provided them with a car gratuitously.

On their way to the borderline, sensitive Wolverine detected Deadpool's previously "educated wish" and triggered a brawl in the car, until both of them lost consciousness.

Laura, took them to the rebels' basement where three other mutants inhabited, and asked the unwilling Wolverine to concur with their crusade against Nova, which Wolverine complied eventually.

Under the alliance of potent teammates, Wolverine and Deadpool broke in Nova's liar, though they were instantly defeated by Nova. Nova read Wolverine's mind and knew about he was repellent to others because of his uncontrollable, indiscriminate massacre towards human aroused by the loss of friends. When she was exploiting this weakness, Deadpool received Laura's souvenir and controlled Nova successfully with the lid capable of suppressing her superpower. 

However, Nova could not send them home without superpower and even threatened to kill them all once the lid was taken off. At that very moment, Nova's inferior Pyra shot Nova for rage hibernated for a long time, although he was immediately resolved by Deadpool. Wolverine reminisced about Xavier who definitely wouldn't bear Wolverine watching his sister die and accordingly commanded Deadpool to release her. Nova thanked them for saving her life and opened their gate home despite calling Alioth again to spice things up.

Nova was misled by Pyra that Paradox was the culprit, thereby she reached for Paradox who was then and there arguing with the duo.

Nova deployed various Deadpools to impede the duo, while she herself went to amplify the sabotage of the ripper so as to destroy more universes. When the duo bogged down in the army, bodPeter, Deadpool's best buddy, came out to liberate the duo. 

Paradox told them short circuiting two leads with one of their bodies might save the day albeit at the cost of the life. Deadpool intended to sacrifice, granted that Wolverine was an innocent passerby primarily, whereas Wolverine wanted this task, since unlike Deadpool who rescued the world for friends he cared about, Wolverine had nothing to lose. 
Deadpool acknowledged Wolverine's heroic act, yet knocked Wolverine down to take it down alone. Nevertheless, Deadpool could not fill the gap between two leads and this scheme appeared to fail. Fortunately, the exasperated Wolverine managed to tear the door open and hold Deadpool's arm to accomplish the feat of crushing Nova.

Paradox'a illegal behaviour was sensed and interrogated by his superior who then celebrated Deadpool's universe actually regenerated owing to this Wolverine, and brought their teammates back to their respective home under the request of Deadpool. In the end, Deadpool adopted Dogpool, invited Wolverine to be his roommate, came back to the embrace of friends, and won the favor of his ex-girlfriend under the help of Wolverine.

# Core: 3/9. The scriptwriters were mimicking a literally commonplace template called the hero's odyssey without caring for the inner logic of the plots and characters.
+ The duo could find materials to connect the leads instead of trusting Paradox, an antagonist who was determined to exterminate the entire universe at first and sacrificing themselves hot-headedly.
+ Why did the duo survive?
+ Why did no subordinates report Paradox's delinquency? 
+ Why didn't Wolverine care about the possibility that all of them got killed due to his untimely beneficence ?
+ Why did Deadpool run for Wolverine's grave first, for everyone including him knew Wolverine had already dead?
+ Why did the teammates let the duo abandon them and leave the dangerous Nova behind?
+ Why did the teammates accept Deadpool's and whimsical plan after many deaths of powerful allies?
+ what is the usage of a diner that had food in the rural area of the void? For Deadpools?
+ Why did Paradox tell Deadpool the truth before he finished the destruction? Did he not worry about Deadpool informed other people of this evil conspiracy?

# Character: 6/9.

# World and Others: 4/9.
