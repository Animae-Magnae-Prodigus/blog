# Plot: 6/9. 
## 0 
After being rejected by Avengers, Deadpool became a mundane car salesman along with Peter—his best friend—while sulking over his last breakup. While he and friends were celebrating his birthday, he was abruptly abducted by Mr. Paradox, an officer of TVA, who was here to offer Deadpool a job and also informed Deadpool that there was no need for him to go home, because Deadpool's universe lost its anchor being—Wolverine—and was therefor going to wither in thousands of years later. But Paradox thought it considerable and honorable of him to expedite this inevitable ending by launching the ripper several days later.

## 1
Refusing this tragic fate, Deadpool robbed Paradox of his gadget, returned to his original universe, and exhumed  Wolverine's grave—only to confirm that Wolverine of this universe was indeed dead. Out of disappointment or entertainment, he just desecrated Wolverine's carcass as weapons to mow down Paradox's pursuing henchmen one by one, before he traveled through different universes to find a suitable substitute for Wolverine.

When Deadpool finally handed an available yet disheartening Wolverine over to Paradox, the latter derided that this Wolverine was too bad to redeem this universe, and subsequently threw the duo directly to the void. After landing, Wolverine, reluctant to help Deadpool, fought him ferociously, until Deadpool lied that TVA could change the time to undo Wolverine's past mistakes, which certainly struck the right chord of Wolverine.

But then, they were captured by Cassandra Nova—the malevolent sister of the duo's mutual acquaintance, Xavier—and barely escaped from the maw of a monster called Alioth.

After brief dining, they met Nicepool and his Dogpool and received a car from him.

On their way to the borderline, sensitive Wolverine detected Deadpool's previously "educated wish" and triggered a brawl in the car, leaving both of them unconscious.

Laura took them to the rebels' basement, where three other insurgent mutants inhabited, and asked the unwilling Wolverine to concur with their crusade against Nova, which Wolverine complied eventually.

Under the alliance of potent teammates, Wolverine and Deadpool broke in Nova's liar, though they were instantly defeated by Nova. Nova read Wolverine's mind where Wolverine confessed that he once committed an uncontrollable, indiscriminate, and regretful massacre triggered by the loss of friends. When she was exploiting this weakness, Deadpool obtained Laura's souvenir and controlled Nova successfully with the lid capable of suppressing her superpower. 

However, Nova could not send them home without superpower, and even threatened to kill them all once the lid was taken off. At that very moment, Nova's inferior, Pyra, shot Nova out of revengeful rage hibernated for a long time, although he was immediately resolved by Deadpool. Wolverine reminisced about Xavier who definitely would never allow Wolverine to watch his sister die, and accordingly commanded Deadpool to release her. Nova thanked them for saving her life and opened their gateway home—despite summoning Alioth again to spice things up.

Nova was misled by Pyra that Paradox was the culprit, prompting her to confronting Paradox who was then and there arguing with the duo. Nova deployed various Deadpools including Nicepool to impede the duo, while she herself went to amplify the sabotage of the ripper so as to destroy more universes. When the duo bogged down in the army, Peter, Deadpool's best buddy, came out to liberate the duo.

Paradox told them short circuiting two leads with one of their bodies might save the day, albeit at the cost of the executor's life. Deadpool intended to sacrifice himself—granted that Wolverine was an innocent passerby primarily brought in by him—whereas Wolverine wanted this task, since unlike Deadpool who rescued the world for friends he cared about, Wolverine had nothing to lose now. 
Although Deadpool acknowledged Wolverine's heroic act, yet he knocked Wolverine down and locked the gate to handle the challenge alone. Nevertheless, Deadpool could not fill the gap between two leads and this scheme appeared to fail. Fortunately, the exasperated Wolverine managed to tear the door open and hold Deadpool's arm to accomplish the feat of crushing Nova.

Paradox'a illegal behaviour was sensed and interrogated by his superior, who then celebrated the regeneration of Deadpool's universe, and brought their teammates back to their respective home under the request of Deadpool. In the end, Deadpool adopted Dogpool, invited Wolverine to be his roommate, came back to the embrace of friends, and won the favor of his ex-girlfriend under the help of Wolverine.

# Core: 2/9. The scriptwriters merely mimicked a literally commonplace template called the hero's odyssey without regard to the inner logic of the plots and characters.
+ The duo could have found alternative materials to connect the leads, instead of trusting Paradox—an antagonist who determined to exterminate the entire universe at first—and sacrificing themselves hot-headedly.
+ Why did the duo survive?
+ Why did none of Paradox's subordinates report his delinquency? 
+ Why didn't Wolverine care about the possibility that all of them got killed due to his untimely beneficence?
+ Why did Deadpool rush to Wolverine's grave first, when everyone including himself, knew Wolverine was already dead?
+ Why did the teammates feel when the duo abandoned them and left the dangerous Nova behind?
+ Why did the teammates accept Deadpool's and whimsical plan after so many deaths of powerful allies?
+ What was the usage of a diner serving food in the rural void? Was it for Deadpools?
+ Why did Paradox reveal the truth to Deadpool before finishing the destruction? Did he not worry about Deadpool exposed his evil conspiracy to other people in this universe?

# Character: 7/9.

# World and Others: 4/9.
