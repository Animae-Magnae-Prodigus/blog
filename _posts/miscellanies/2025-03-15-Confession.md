3 Reasons:

# The innate problem of the book

Some of the context was too bad for me to go on, because Vandermeers didn't read through all the works so as to cull the best of those comprehensive authors at home and abroad, especially those foreign authors, which accounted for the ultimate laughingstock of the quantity over the quality.

# The change of value
I think the best of science fiction doesn't lie in the short stories, because the wonderful world building which is why I favor science-fiction over others could not be rendered without a complete degeneration of other perspectives in this form actually.

As a result, I would like to next read the essence of science fiction that exists only in the form of tomes and only read the best, the awarded, the famous, or just my favorites hereafter.

# The change of method to accomplish the same initial ambition
I initiated to do this to improve my literary experience and literacy, but now I have found a better method:
	
Instead of bombarding the weaknesses of works with acrimonious criticism, it would be more beneficial for my personal growth by finding the advantages of these works, imitating them, and eventually absorbing their distinctive essence, since I don't want to be a nay-sayer till the end of my life where the subject I will complain at that time turns out to be that I cannot bring up a self-satisfying work owing to my incapacity of becoming a yeah-sayer.
