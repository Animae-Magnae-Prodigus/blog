+ The short story often acts as a small window to leak the information of their authors including the writing style. Thus it's the most efficient activity to make clear of my taste or distaste, as well as to find the authors or topics I would like to explore more.
+ It's the minimal activity to identify various authors' shortcomings and advantages in storytelling, and ergo enable me to avoid or improve these points within my own writing. Some stories that didn't age well or received clamors only decades later would give me a good lesson on the humanity and history.
+ I can encounter new friends with all sorts of problems and intentions, witness unfamiliar, bizarre, and sometimes unforgettable virtual world, and last but not least, experienced a brand-new storyline full of emotions, with the minimum effort and time.
