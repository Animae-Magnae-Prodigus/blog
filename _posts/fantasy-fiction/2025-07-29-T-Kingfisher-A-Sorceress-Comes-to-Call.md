# Plot: 5/9. It is predictable, lengthy, boring and lackluster.
Cordelia's mother called Evangeline was a manipulative sorceress living by enchanting rich men. One day Cordelia was notified that her mother's benefactor had fallen in love with another woman and the benefactor was the father of his best friend, Ellen. Evangeline quickly found a new target—a kind Squire inviting both of them into his house.

Evangeline staged a cabriolet accident to extend her stay at the Squire's house and facilitate her leverage on the Squire. Hester, the Squire's sister, felt threatened and hence invited her lover Richard, Penelope, Imogen and Imogen's husband to participate in a household party. 




Evangeline was so jealous of Penelope's charm that she manipulated Penelope to murder her servant before committing suicide in front of others. Cordelia, still guilty of Ellen's family's previous bloody holocaust caused by her mother, felt obliged to stop her mother's further wrongdoings. So she confined in Hester, who had cared for her deeply from beginning. Astounded at the revelation, Hester sent Richard immediately to investigate Ellen's family.

Richard was convinced of the existence of sorcery after investigation, when the Squire proposed to Evangeline. As a result, to prolong their lives, Hester asked Richard to propose to Cordelia so that Evangeline had to rely on Hester to chaperone Cordelia.

While Evangeline and the Squire were honeymooning elsewhere, Cordelia, Hester, Richard and Imogen occupied themselves in finding the way of annulling the magic. They found an recipe might work and experimented on Evangeline's familiar called Falada. However, the method failed—probably because of the improper candidate of the wine.

Fearing Falada would report remotely to Evangeline, they decapitated Falada. But Falada dug out of the ground and abducted Cordelia to Evangeline. Evangeline was so enraged that she controlled Cordelia to kill Richard. At this critical moment, Penelope volunteered for the position of wine. The group accomplished the ceremony of driving away Evangeline's magic power and Falada ended Evangeline's life.

In the end, Cordelia was adopted by Richard with Hester continuing to serve as her chaperone.



# Core: 2/9. The reason why they didn't murder Evangeline immediately was because Hester wanted her brother to stop being enchanted, but why didn't Cordelia tell Hester that her mother didn't do that trick? Why didn't Cordelia make an effort to prove the innocence of her mother's victims like Penelope, and warn the society of the threat of sorcery? Why did the group asked for the church's help, given that the wedding proved workable in dispelling the magic?



# Character: 4/9. 



# World and Others: 4/9.
