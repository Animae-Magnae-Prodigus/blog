# Plot: 5/9. This work would have been better if James Lee Burke had not misused his lousy multiple points of perspective to narrate the main plot, because it lacked the cosmetic ability to portray characters from a distance stably, haphazardly interrupted the most exciting storyline from time to time, and intensified the dullness of every chapter further with characters' unnecessary introspection and descriptions.
Pierre Cauchon was a constable in charge of investigating the murder of Mr. Suarez. When he asked the suspect Hannah for information, he was humiliated by her owner, Mr. Lufkin, and so in retaliation, arrested Hannah and subjected her to abuse in prison.
Wade Lufkin, Mr. Lufkin's nephew, was fascinated by Hannah and challenged Cauchon to a duel, incurring his own disfigurement.

At the same time, Florence Milton, an abolitionist and a teacher, helped Hannah to escape from jail at the request of Wade. These two women suffered a tough journey, during which Florence even accidentally killed an innocent Union soldier who had tried to warn Hannah of the impending danger.

A predatory Union officer called Endicott sought to punish the Lufkin family for their previous accommodation to a group of irregulars led by a pious barbarian Colonel Carleton Hayes. Wade was forced to flee, after squabbling with Endicott. And as a result, Endicott sabotaged Lufkin's residence. Wade subsequently encountered the women and supported the irregulars financially for a temporary haven.

Endicott then raped Darla Babineaux, a already emancipated slave who had formerly owned by Suarez and had fallen in love with Wade so much that she confessed that it was her that had killed the rapist Suarez. Wade stole Suarez's treasure, of which location Darla had revealed to him previously. Desperate for the treasure, Endicott humiliated Darla in public so as to stimulate Wadeâ€”who responded by just shooting them all and getting away with Darla.

Cauchon apologised for his earlier impulsive behaviour and solicited Wade's favour. Endicott chasing after them sent a letter to exchange Hannah's lost son for these two. They arrived at the agreed-upon place, where Hannah finally reunited with her son and abandoned her friends.

Eventually, Florence and Darla joined forces to kill Endicott together. Feeling God's direction, Hannah came back soon. The epilogue stated all the remaining protagonists lived a peaceful and happy life on a small American island.





# Core: 5/9. It is just a mediocre historical novel without any decent detective activities around the beginning mystery.
Plus, the conflicts were too lackluster to support a full-length novel. I had originally supposed the ending would contain a vivid description on either a war or a skirmish between irregulars and the Union Army.


# Character: 6/9. Highlights on the women were unexpectedly impressive.


# World and Others: 6/9.
