# Plot: 5/9. It's a comedy containing a little mystery.
Bartram, a private effective, came to the Black Widowers to consult his unsolved case of which Anderson, an acquisitive collector, doubted Jackson, his ex-partner who had once worked in his house, had pilfered something important but unnoticeable from him just because Jackson let off an acquisitive chuckle after he left the place.

But unfortunately they couldn't found anything lost in Anderson's house. After Anderson died last month, he couldn't help asking Jackson, namely the waiter, for the truth. 

Henry said, "Only his peace of mind, sir."

# Core: 4/9. It's easily guessed one.


# Character: 6/9. Avalon was a bit demanding. Henry was respectable for his honesty. Anderson was pitiful for his endless doubt and cruelty.


# World and Others: 0/9. 



# Overall: 4/9.
