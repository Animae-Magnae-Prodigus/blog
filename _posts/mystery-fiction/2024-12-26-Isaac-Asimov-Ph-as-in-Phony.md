# Plot: 4/9. Talking of the background of today's guest, Drake couldn't help recalling Faron, his mediocre yet wealthy classmate who once got an unusual high score to apply to PHD. He thought Faron must have cheated but didn't know how he did it. Henry thought it's the professor who was bought and connived at the cheat.



# Core: 3/9. It's so easily guessed that I have the answer before Drake told the whole story off. But it's funny that PH.D. stood for Phony Doctor.


# Character: 6/9. Rubin was the "animated phonograph needle" who claimed loudly that honesty was a flaw. Trumbull was a considerate man who observed Drake's restlessness and gave him priority. Henry was integrate yet astute probably owing to his experience of working with his shrewd ex-partner.
> It seems to me that you are too much at home with petty dishonesty to understand it very well.



# World and Others: 4/9. It indeed made me feel at home with the depicted atmosphere.



# Overall: 4/9. Even though the mystery was minor or even banal, I would like to read more because of good characters and the environment. I guessed that's why Asimov was so popular.
