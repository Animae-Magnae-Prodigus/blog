# Plot: 5/9.
## When no man pursueth 4/9
The guest said he was confused that his editor bought a story without publishing it.

Henry guessed that the editor's real purpose of buying the article was to hide it because a part of the article implicated his deceased wife's heart disease, which might trigger something in the husband's mind.

## Quicker than the eye 5/9
The guest wondered how could a man pass a conspicuous object in the restaurant abundant with their close surveillance.

Henry thought that the target might camouflage himself with the customary action of tipping the doorman.

## The iron gem 6/9
Why did a man offer a considerable amount of money for a worthless heirloom by bidding a laughably low price at first, jumping to an incredible offer afterward, and threatening the owner after being rejected without actually disturbing the owner hereafter?

Because these actions could effectively distract the number's attention from the real valuable heirloom—the stamp attached to the inconspicuous package which was probably stolen by the man at that time.

## The three numbers 4/9
The guest asked them to decode a combination of the safe left by his colleagues.

Henry guessed the guest had mistook the lowercase letter "l" for the number "1".

## Nothing like murder 2/9
The Russian guest claimed he heard two college students were planning a murder in broad daylight beside him in the park because they supposed him as a foreigner unfamiliar to English.

Henry thought they were just talking about Tolkien's thematic poems, which was eventually confirmed by this guest.

(The word murder also refers to a group of crows, which acted in accordance with the fact that crows like snuggling together in cold winter. But this assumption ignored the aforementioned theme related to best-sellers and therefore I admitted that Asimov's answer bettered mine.

However, the reasons I don't like this article had nothing to do with my failure:

Firstly, I just feel it unacceptable to introduce unfamiliar elements into the ultimate answer of the mystery without rendering thorough explorations or assumptions by side characters in advance. The hint of popular novels was too broad without any efficient specification.

What's more, it would be more interesting or dramatic if Henry gave the final conclusion when the conundrum confused all the other brilliant minds in the assembly.

Finally, how could a fluent foreigner mistake a poem having a peculiar rhythm for a conversation about a real horrid scheme?)

## No smoking 2/9

Today's guest said he had once rejected a candidate merely because of his unsolicited behaviour of smocking. The decision had turned out as a disaster because the other candidate eventually absconded with corporate money of which the location was lost due to his accidental death.

Henry judged that candidate was an accomplice of the burglary from the account of lighting a cigarette with just one hand in the interview, because this adept behaviour indicated that's an impromptu performance to undervalue himself intentionally.

(This answer didn't explain why this man intentionally abandoned the opportunity of promotion and made me wonder what exactly they had conspired before the interview, since normally a person wouldn't agree an unfair scheme where one side could be safe and sound while the other side must run the risk of being caught.)

## Season's greeting 6/9
The guest and his wife had a predilection for posting their received greeting cards to the wall of their house and inviting friends to appreciate these elaborations. But today they received a plain, somewhat ugly card whose sender was a stranger unheard of.

Henry suspected that considering the enormous incoming flow of letters, the guest's address could be the best camouflage for the postman to transform some confidential information.

## The one and only east 6/9
The guest's uncle bequeathed him thousands of dollars posthumously as long as the guest could guess out the city indicating the one and only east from the six options.

I love the moment when members gave diverse solutions to this puzzle out of their plausible reasons. In the end, Henry looked up the old map and found the city his uncle had used to live in had once bore the name of east.

## Earthset and evening star 4/9
> As a mystery reader, I find it my satisfying to have the piece of information delivered to me and to find that I have been insufficiently clever and did not notice.

In the beginning of the assembly, the mystery writer thought it needed great skills to hide necessary clues of the answer in a natural fashion to avoid "the idiot plot".

Today's guest thought the quarrel on the location of the site of the lunar foundation between him and his partner derided from his partner's wife's sudden suicide. He said he once accidentally found his wife hanging out intimately with another man who disappeared strangely after the unexpected suicide.

Henry assumed it's the name of the site resembling the wife's secret lover that had possibly irritated his partner. He also demanded the guest to investigate the safety of the lover in case the husband already killed him out of anger.

(Would it possible the wife committed suicide out of the husband's threat over the safety of her secret lover?)

## Friday the thirteen 8/9
Today's guest wanted to clear his superstitious grandfather-in-law named Hennessy from the prosecution of assassinating the president despite Hennessy's suspicious letter written on Friday the thirteen in which he told his friend:

+ Their plan was completed and their job will undoubtedly be finished next month no matter how high the cost they would pay.
+ The God's finger have already touched a poor man.
+ But God's mercy allowed a forty-year miracle that would not give them Friday the thirteen next month.

The math teacher gave the information on the compilation of the calender, which made it possible for Henry to pinpoint the exact date indicated by the letter and hence deduce its true meaning:

+ The letter was written on Friday, February 13, 1920 because normally two consecutive months would never have the same Friday the thirteen unless the leading month was the February, and only the February of the leap year wasn't followed by the same Friday the thirteen.
+ On March 12, 1920, Hennessy helped Debs—a poor man who was in the jail at that day to collect votes for the presidency, which accounted for the plan and the job.
+ Hennessy's gratitude of a forty-year miracle derived from the fact that only in 1880, there existed a Friday 13 not followed by another one. Usually the pattern of the calender repeated every 28 years but the omission of the leap years in 1900 disturbed the rules and prolonged the gap to 40 years.

(I once learnt about the algorithm behind the Gregorian calender because of the requirement of a program, but it never occurred to me that this concept could be woven into a mystery story. Amazing!)

## The unabridged 3/9
The guest wanted to find the most valuable stamp hidden by his uncle, but all the clues he got was once his aunt heard from his uncle that he hid it in "one of the unabridged volumes". They hired a butch of naive children to examine all the collected books page by page but unfortunately found nothing at all.

Henry considered that since his aunt was fastidious about her language and therefore chances were that the original locution of "unabridged" was "uncut", indicating the possible location would be the inner bags of those uncut books.

(Yes, I didn't know the fact that some old books have inner bags and henceforth didn't realized the answer absolutely.)

## The ultimate crime 3/9
Today's guest intended to write a fictional essay mentioned in Sherlock Holmes named the dynamic of an asteroid featuring high-class mathematics at that time, but he found it impossible to find an apposite astronomical research fulfilling requirements.

In the end, Henry suggested he should write a hypothetical asteroid orbiting between Mars and Jupiter long time ago but leaving behind only fragments now because of an explosion. Furthermore, he supplemented that the essay was suppressed, for other mathematicians sensed his evil reference of a similar explosion concerned with the Earth.

(Personally, however much I admired Asimov's splendiferous knowledge on the astronomy, I didn't think it's an adequate issue for the general mystery for the entertainment.)

# Core: 5/9. Asimov's amazing knowledge couldn't obfuscate his sometimes inadequacy of the choice about the topic of mysteries and the lack of thorough elaboration on the elimination of other possibilities.

To be more frankly, for me, it is not enough for a story created only backward from an answer merely known by the author, because the forward pursuit to the answer also plays an important role, which Asimov sometimes failed to reach.

# Character: 5/9. Admiringly, Asimov fabricated lively characters living in America of last century.

My dissatisfaction lay at the fact that Asimov didn't exploit all the possibility related to characters' respective vocations and therefor give each other an opportunity to show themselves especially their advantages in every story. It is tedious to always appreciate only one character.

# World and Others: 4/9.
