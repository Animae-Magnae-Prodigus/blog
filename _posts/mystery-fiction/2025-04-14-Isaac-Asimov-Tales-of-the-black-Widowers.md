# Plot: 5/9.
## The acquisitive chuckle
A detective wondered what kind of object would one steal to go unnoticed yet irritate a mercenary businessman to death?

Henry answered that he didn't steal anything but the poor businessman's equanimity.

## Ph as in phony
A chemist wondered how his relatively mediocre classmate had managed to cheat in a tough examination under his own close surveillance.

Henry replied that the classmate might buy the professor directly.

## Truth to tell
One man, whose characteristics was to always tell the truth regardless of the social convention and self-protection, asked the widowers to help him abate the suspect of a burglary that he claimed he never ever had committed.

Henry noticed the abnormality of using the exactly identical phrases in his affidavit and then pointed out he might just tell the literal truth, which was proved by the abrupt departure and the absence of response.

> If we cannot lie, we must make the truth lie for us.

> Many a literal truth tells a lie by implication.

## Go, little books

How could information be passed inconspicuously by purely sending the matchbooks?

By marking the matchs within it.

## Early Sunday morning

How could a husband create an alibi of staying with brother-in-law when his wife was killed?

By manipulating the brother-in-law's unawareness of the daylight saving time.

## The obvious factor

How could a woman auger a precognition under the observance of a mass of suspicious scientists?

This is fabricated by the storyteller intentionally. Henry pointed out this because he observed that the storyteller always tended to bring up a spate of new evidence that would be more suitable to be given at first in order to dispel others' speculation.

# The pointing finger
The stroked grandpa pointed to a book written by Shakespeare to indicate the location of the bond before he died suddenly during the process without further revelation. His son-in-law perused every line of the book while the wife searched every corner of the house, both of which proved futile. Where did the grandpa hide the bond?

Henry indicated the place between the bookcase and the wall.

# Miss what
A plainclothesman came to test Henry by demonstrating a note whose sender seemed to aim at attacking one of the beauty contestants representing their corresponding countries. So the gentlemen occupied themselves in decoding the reference against the bible.

Eventually, Henry deducted from the discussion that the reference might mean the leviathan, the largest sea monster allegedly, and therefore drew an analogy between whales and Wales, which proved true.

(It was an abundantly boring article boasting of Asimov's understanding of the bible, and would be better if Henry prolonged the deliberation of his quick wit or put a higher stake at the answer.)

## The lullaby of Broadway
Henry felt suspicious when he found the doorman omitted telling them the burglary and the strange sound related to Rubin, so he at last made an audacious assumption that the noise Rubin had heard was the transmission of secret information to the Chinese delegation nearby and the burglary was meant to take back Rubin's recording of their espionage.
(But for me, this is a terrible article because I don't think it reasonable and efficient to pass intelligence by banging in the midnight. There's a conspicuous vacuum between the clues and the conclusion without decent deduction or dramatic catalysis.)

## Yankee Doddle went to the town
An officer asked them for help to locate a hidden higher officer behind one suspicious member who couldn't help humming some part of the titular song during the interrogation.

Henry found the name of the target might rhyme with the name appeared in the song so that the member subconsciously let out the answer.

(Frankly speaking, I would like it better if others could present their guess so as to set off Henry's far-fetched assumption better.)

## The curious omission

Today's guest wondered where to find the name of the bank storing a considerable amount of heritage that his old friend had bequeathed him as long as he was able to decipher the death note: The curious omission in Alice.

One of the widowers found Alice may refer to the famous Alice in wonderland where the bishop intentionally omitted for the fear of impinging on the religion. Henry thought the specification might be hidden in the bishop of the guest's chess set as the old friend's last derision.

## Out of sight
The guest lost his job because of his accidental leak of the location of classified information at the dinner table, but all of six suspect commensals bore further investigation.

Henry corrected the waiter serving him at the time had been ignored.

# Character: 5/9.
Characters had their own peculiarities and their interactions were lively, causal and cordial if only more of personal information about them would have been concealed, especially Henry whose intelligence and acuity were perfectly unfit to be just a waiter.

# Core: 6/9.
Though I could always guess out the answer before the eventual disclosure easily unless it's out of my knowledge base such as the bible or the folk song, yet I enjoyed the comic representation of a foreshadowing containing various speculations by a butch of befuddled intelligent with a convincing solution revealed by a demeaning waiter.

And here are some lessons concluded from this work in the 1973:

+ The import of the case must be interesting enough to arouse readers' interest.
+ The intellectuals should render their own distinctive assumptions based on characteristics or experience but still left some moot points. (Some of stories I don't like in this edition all ignored this important part of bringing out depth of side characters.)
+ The waiter solved the answer by absorbing their views in an unexpected perspective, which could be corroborated somehow in conclusion.

# World and Others: 4/9.
