# Plot: 0/9.

## The Cross of Lorraine 3/9
The guest wanted to find the woman whose destination was "the cross of Lorraine" according to a little French boy who didn't understand any English and witnessed her departure in the early morning. However, he couldn't find any symbol resembling the sign or location containing the name.

Henry thought the most likely noticeable things in the darkness would be a coruscating sign. And the boy might indicate the double X on the sign of the gas station.

(It rendered me a terrible reading experience because I'm not acquainted with the American signs. So even if I realized the boy may indicate things or their parts like the sign, but I got confused when the guest supplemented there were nothing on the road resembling that.)

## The family man 3/9
The guest wondered why a cold, rootless and childless criminal could demonstrate the humane affection while talking about Christmas and Halloween.

Henry supposed the fact that the criminal concurred with the guest congenially probably derived from a coincidence that 31 (Oct) equals 25 (Dec) from the predictive of a computer specialist.

(The final conclusion was so abrupt that it barely gave me appropriate time to think about the connection between the numerical base and the answer. It would be more adequate to introduce the mathematical information during the initial discussion. Of course, I should become my sensitive on the tips mentioned from Henry next time.)

(Also, how I miss a complicated yet diminutive mystery that can be explored progressively and explicated thoroughly from various unique perspectives.)
