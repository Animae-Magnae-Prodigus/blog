title: "Review ?/9 | Delphi Classics -  The World’s Greatest Poems: AN ANTHOLOGY"
tags: 2015 poetry anthology Delphi
---

The score here only implies my personal judgment and subjective sentiment. For example, I would probably score lower or stop further reading for incomprehensible poems or poems of blank verse and score higher for poems I love.
Moreover, I could accept rhymed lines with irregular word counts, but I abhor the abrupt line break within an integral phrase for the sake of rhyme. 

Interestingly, I often feel reading poems before 19 century is confusing and painful especially those concerned with religion, tales or substandard English. 

I suppose there exists an impossible triangle of a poem:
+ Clearness
+ Soundness: in terms of breaks, meters, rhymes and tones 
+ Lengthiness

> 

> Art is long, and Time is fleeting,  **And our hearts, though stout and brave, Still, like muffled drums, are beating     Funeral marches to the grave.**

> 

> In the world’s broad field of battle,  In the bivouac of Life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle!  Be a hero in the strife!   
 

> Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!  Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act, — act in the living Present!  Heart within, and God o’erhead!

> Had he thy reason, would he skip and play

> ...

# An Essay on Man: Epistle II — Of the Nature and State of Man with Respect to Himself, as an Individual. 4/9.
Frankly speaking, I don't understand most of the text though it sounds good.


> with too much knowledge for the sceptic's side , 

> with too much weakness for the stoic's pride 

> he hangs between ; in doubt to act or rest 

> in doubt to deem himself a God or beast 

> in doubt his mind or body to prefer 

> born but to die , and reasoning but to err 

> ...

# An Essay on Man: Epistle III — Of the Nature and State of Man with Respect to Society. 4/9.  
Although still, I don't understand most of his poem, but I sense Alexander Pope want to preach about the enlightenment and it sounds indeed sonorous.

> ...

> here too all forms of social union find 

> and hence let reason , late , instruct mankind 


# An Essay on Man: Epistle IV — Of the Nature and State of Man with Respect to Happiness. 5/9. interesting and genuine

> thou wert my guide , philosopher and friend ?

> from sounds to things , from fancy to art 

> for wits' false mirror held up nature's light 

> showed erring pride , whatever is, is right 

> that reason , passion , answer a great aim 

> that true self-love and social are the same 

> that virtue only makes our bliss below 

> and all our knowledge is, ourselves to know 

In *An Essay on Man: The Design*, Pope claimed his aim of writing these epistles was to open the fountains and clear the passages, this philosophical poem is indeed a moving endeavour.


# An Ode: 6/9. 

> What constitutes a state?

> not high raised battlement or laboured mound 

> thick wall or moated gate 

> not cities proud with spires and turrets crowned 

> ...
