# Principle
A good reader becomes commentator.

A better reader becomes author.

A best reader becomes philosopher.

# Introduction
Here reside my notes and comments on books, offered to fellow bibliophiles who share my common reading predilections.

# Rules
+ The titles of my commenting posts follow the pattern of "scores I gave \| Author Name - Work Name".

+ **Spoiler Alert**: For more details or reasons, go ahead the links. **Don't click the links of my notes below unless you want to read spoilers!**

+ No other elements can get scores higher than the score of "plot" in my reviews on fiction. According my aesthetics, "Plot" is the bone of fiction and anything else are just like muscles and fat. Without the proper bone, the work cannot be seen as a working fiction.

+ Only science fiction and detective fiction take the element of "core" into account.
