# Principle
+ A good reader becomes a commentator.

+ A better reader becomes an author.

+ A best reader becomes a philosopher.

# Introduction
Here reside my notes and comments on books, offered to fellow bibliophiles who share the same reading predilections as me.

For me, the reason why **science fiction** move me so much is because some of the best of them could provide me with exotic **situations**,  dramatic **emotions**, fabulous **visions** and marvelous **solutions**.

Some of the best of **detective fiction** also possess me with their plausible **speculations** in addition to the aforementioned qualities.


# Rules
+ The titles of my commenting posts follow the pattern of "Property of the post with scores I gave \| Author Name - Work Name".

+ **Spoiler Alert**: For more details or reasons, go ahead the links. **Don't click the links of my notes below unless you want to read spoilers!**
