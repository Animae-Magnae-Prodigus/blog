# Principle
A good reader becomes commentator.

A better reader becomes author.

A best reader becomes philosopher.

# Introduction
Here reside my notes and comments on books, offered to fellow bibliophiles who share my common reading predilections.

# Rules
+ The titles of my commenting posts follow the pattern of "scores I gave \| Author Name - Work Name".

+ **Spoiler Alert**: For more details or reasons, go ahead the links. **Don't click the links of my notes below unless you want to read spoilers!**

+ Only science fiction and detective fiction take the aspect of core into account.
